Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

2
00:00:02,263 --> 00:00:04,810
What I want is to work
at Pearson Specter

3
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:05,789
and to keep seeing you.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,391
Those two things are not
both gonna happen.

5
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:08,892
You've been here
for three months.

6
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,944
All you've done is hit singles,
and I need a goddamn home run.

7
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:12,095
- Jonathan, listen--
- I don't want to hear it.

8
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,530
Start making us
some real money.

9
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:15,232
A man like Walter Gillis

10
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,234
isn't gonna listen
to a guy like you,

11
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:19,620
offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

12
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:21,905
Walter, I can't guarantee you
we'll win,

13
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,442
but I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

14
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,411
All right,
I'm in.

15
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,445
You're talking
hostile takeover.

16
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:29,580
Gillis industries--

17
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:30,947
Logan, we have a conflict.

18
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,282
You're either with me
or against me.

19
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,751
That includes all $1 billion
of my business.

20
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,921
Get moving on drawing up a
tender offer for Logan Sanders.

21
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,256
Do you remember
when I told you

22
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,726
that I once had an affair
with a married man?

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,862
It was him.

24
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,067
You're up early.

25
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,069
So are you.

26
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:53,904
Well, I have to be.
You don't.

27
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:58,108
I was already awake.
Thinking.

28
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,493
About last night?
Look, Mike, I--

29
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,329
- it's okay.
I'm good.

30
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:05,148
You're good with me working
on the takeover with Logan?

31
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,750
Why do you not
seem to believe me?

32
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:08,318
Because you weren't good
last night.

33
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:09,703
Which was before this morning

34
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:13,457
when I realized that
that's work.

35
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,991
This isn't.

36
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,160
[Exhales deeply]

37
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:21,098
So as long as we don't let
that affect this...

38
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,499
We won't.

39
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:25,519
In that case, let's set
some in-home ground rules.

40
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,387
Obviously, the first--

41
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:29,640
Uh, respecting
each other's privacy.

42
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:30,774
Exactly.

43
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,392
The left-hand side of the desk
belongs

44
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:33,843
to the United Nation of Ross.

45
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:37,197
- You're not a nation.
- I have a flag.

46
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:38,782
[Scoffs] Fine.

47
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,368
As long as we agree
that any perusal of my phone

48
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:44,354
is considered a breach
of my borders.

49
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:45,689
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:47,857
I thought you liked it
when I breached your borders.

51
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:51,828
Mm, well, those are
different kind of borders.

52
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,997
In that case,
a breach is allowed.

53
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,367
- Allowed?
- Encouraged.

54
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:01,037
- Requested.
- Demanded.

55
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:03,724
Let's go make you
late for work.

56
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:07,010
Mm.

57
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,812
Jessica, I am telling you.

58
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,647
The S.E.C. is gonna send
Jeff Malone after us,

59
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:13,883
and nobody is better suited
to beat him down than--

60
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,051
you guessed it

61
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,571
because we all know that

62
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:21,024
this is better than this,

63
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,860
which will result in this,

64
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:27,664
which will also result
in this

65
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,233
and this

66
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:33,903
and this.

67
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,905
And what do I want in return?

68
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:40,177
Oh, you know what I want.

69
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:42,179
You've always known.

70
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:44,047
And after I win,

71
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:48,084
you'll not only be willing
to give it to me.

72
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:53,307
You're gonna be begging
to give it to me.

73
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:55,692
Ha!

74
00:02:58,563 --> 00:02:59,696
- Louis.
- B--not now.

75
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:01,732
- Louis, I have to talk to you.
- B--not now.

76
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,099
How many times
have I told you?

77
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,285
Unless you have photoshopped
my head onto a dragon,

78
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,953
do not interrupt me
while I'm perfecting my pitch.

79
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,538
Your pitch doesn't need
to be perfect.

80
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:09,573
It needs to be now.

81
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,940
- Why?
- Malone is here.

82
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,493
- He's here?
- In the lobby.

83
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:14,865
And Jessica just asked
to see you.

84
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,913
Oh, out of my way.

85
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,249
Aren't--aren't you going
to bring your easel?

86
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,252
Oh, I don't need an easel
to kick this sucker's ass.

87
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,424
Jessica.

88
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,927
Jessica, I got your message,
and I just wanted to--

89
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,763
Louis, this is Jeff Malone.

90
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:35,632
Yeah, I know who he is.
He's with the S.E.C.

91
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,402
He was
until this morning.

92
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:39,969
We brought him over
because we have reason

93
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,488
to believe
they'll be coming after us.

94
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,073
Wait, what?

95
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,775
Jeff is
our newest senior partner.

96
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:50,447
He's going to be taking on
the S.E.C.

97
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,915
Because you suck.

98
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:54,484
And I wanted to introduce him
to you first

99
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,753
because you're a loser.

100
00:03:56,788 --> 00:04:00,924
Who can get him up to speed
on Felton Securities.

101
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:06,663
Because you're never
going to be name partner.

102
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:09,049
And you're both experts
in finance.

103
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,134
Louis, I'm really looking
forward to working with you

104
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,170
on Felton Securities.

105
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,775
Yeah, me too.

106
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,112
You suck.
You're a loser.

107
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:25,198
Louis?

108
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,484
Is there something else?

109
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,687
No.

110
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:32,122
Nothing.

111
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,703
[Inhales sharply]

112
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,138
How long you been
working on that?

113
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:49,222
Two hours.

114
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:50,540
You know it's called
a brief, right?

115
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:52,008
You know
his name's Harvey, right?

116
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,977
You make
a compelling argument.

117
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,011
So I got your note.

118
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:59,215
What do you wanna talk about?
Um...

119
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,216
Logan Sanders.

120
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:01,351
What about him?

121
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:05,054
We sort of dated
a few years ago.

122
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,391
Wait, hang on.
Define "sort of."

123
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,611
- Definitely.
- Define "dated."

124
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:13,063
We had an affair
while he was married.

125
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:14,097
Holy shit.

126
00:05:14,102 --> 00:05:15,385
I know.
And I--

127
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,917
Yes, you have
to tell Harvey.

128
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:19,202
Because, Rachel, if there's
two things that Harvey hates,

129
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,706
it's things being kept from him
and things being kept from him.

130
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,624
- I know.
- Then what am I doing here?

131
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:26,075
I don't know
how to tell him.

132
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,678
Quickly, because Logan's
gonna be here in an hour.

133
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:30,013
What?

134
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,915
And, Rach, it's less important
how you tell Harvey

135
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,550
than that you tell Harvey.

136
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,386
Go.

137
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,473

Okay.

00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:42,108

00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:20,827
I was wondering all day
if you would be--

150
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:22,079
I can't do this.

151
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,647
What?
Rachel--

152
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,649
It's wrong.

153
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,118
Wrong?
You're the one who kissed me.

154
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:29,920
And I was wrong.

155
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,655
No, you weren't.

156
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:32,756
My whole life
I've done everything

157
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,830
that I was supposed to do,

158
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:36,426
and all it did
was make me miserable.

159
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:39,596
Ever since I met you...

160
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:42,182
I can't stop thinking about you,
and all I want to do--

161
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:44,468
Logan--
Logan, if we do this,

162
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:47,003
someone's gonna find out
at some point and then what?

163
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:51,141
I don't care.

164
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:07,357
[Whispering]
Okay.

165
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,710
Harvey, I need to tell you--

166
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:11,828
Rachel?

167
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,466
Logan.

168
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:17,467
Where's Harvey?

169
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:18,802
I don't know.
I'm early.

170
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:20,704
He doesn't like it
when people--

171
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:24,708
- What are you doing here?
- I'm Harvey's associate.

172
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:26,476
You did it.
You went to law school.

173
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,762
Not exactly.
I'm in law school.

174
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:30,013
Rachel, that's great.

175
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,381
I'm really proud of you.

176
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,183
I'm just gonna come back.

177
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:36,820
You came in here to tell him
about us, didn't you?

178
00:07:36,854 --> 00:07:38,405
How'd you know?

179
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,056
It's all over your face.

180
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:41,558
- Logan--
- Please don't tell him.

181
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:44,161
I have to tell him.

182
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:47,497
Rachel...

183
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:49,065
Do you know
what people think

184
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,168
when a son
takes over his father's company?

185
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:52,669
That his father's proud
of him?

186
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:54,671
That he didn't earn it.

187
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:56,873
Which is why I'm not looking
to advertise the fact

188
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:58,592
that I once had an affair.

189
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:01,428
You're not advertising it.
You're disclosing it to counsel.

190
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:03,880
Okay, look,
you want the truth?

191
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:06,550
I'm not proud of the way I was
back then.

192
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:10,437
The way I treated Allison,
the way I treated you.

193
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:11,938
But I'm not that person
anymore,

194
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:14,107
and I don't want people
to think that I am.

195
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:16,259
And I understand that,
but I work for Harvey,

196
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:19,095
and I can't keep things from him
that he needs to know.

197
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:20,564
- He doesn't need to know this.
- Yes, he does.

198
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,932
Why is that?

199
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,985
Because I happen to live
with the man on the other side

200
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:28,872
of the takeover battle.

201
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:37,381
Oh, no.
You need some me time already?

202
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:39,132
It's not me time.

203
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,884
It's "I'm gonna kick
your ass" time.

204
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,221
I think we both know you only
kick ass after eating a hot dog.

205
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:46,473
I could be drinking a juice
box and still kick your ass.

206
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:48,792
I don't think so,
because I have this.

207
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,311
Just read it to me.

208
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:54,481
"Harvey Specter,
you are summoned to"--

209
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:56,983
You gotta be kidding me.
You're subpoenaing me?

210
00:08:57,018 --> 00:08:59,186
Oh, yeah.
I filed a T.R.O.

211
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,570
I'm gonna block
your tender offer.

212
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:01,805
Bullshit, you are.

213
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,407
Well, we'll see what the judge
has to say.

214
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:04,991
Oh, right.
You got your hands full.

215
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:06,660
Here, let me get that for you.
There you go.

216
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:08,645
Hearing's at 2:00.
I'll see you then.

217
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:10,197
Oh, Harvey, the suit--

218
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:13,483
it's a little dated for court,
don't you think?

219
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:17,153
Did you get everything
settled with hr?

220
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:19,339
Yeah.

221
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:22,325
Corner office.
You really must like me.

222
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:25,429
[Chuckles]
Don't get too excited.

223
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:26,880
You know, the last two partners
that had this office

224
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,298
didn't survive the year.

225
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:29,999
Then it's a good thing
I'm much better than they were.

226
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,768
You don't even know
who they were.

227
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,336
That doesn't matter, Jessica.
I know who I am.

228
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:36,673
Me too--
cocky lawyer in a corner office

229
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,642
who hasn't done a thing
for me yet.

230
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:41,311
Yet.

231
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,530
By the way, I understand it's
tradition for the name partner

232
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,964
to welcome a new partner
with lunch.

233
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:48,518
Jeff, when I told you
that our relationship

234
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:50,821
is now purely professional,
I was serious.

235
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,540
Jessica, what's not
purely professional about lunch?

236
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,876
Unless you mean the sex
that will be following lunch?

237
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,828
Oh, you're not hearing me.

238
00:09:57,862 --> 00:10:00,330
Oh, I'm hearing you.
I'm just ignoring you.

239
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,716
But I promise I won't be
ignoring you at lunch.

240
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,634
Cocky.

241
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,311
Harvey. Harvey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

242
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:15,562
Yeah, sure,
come on in.

243
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:17,481
I was actually hoping
that we could talk in my office.

244
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:18,732
What's the--
You're early.

245
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:21,518
- Did you...
- Oh, you two haven't met.

246
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:23,153
Rachel, Logan.
Logan, Rachel.

247
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,654
- I guess you didn't.
- Didn't what?

248
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:26,222
We actually have met before.

249
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,241
That's why I was trying
to find you.

250
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:30,076
- To tell me you met our client?
- No.

251
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:33,229
To tell you that we used to be
in a relationship together.

252
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:37,534
You looking
to get back together?

253
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:38,668
Both: No.

254
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:40,570
- Then I don't give a shit.
- Good.

255
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:42,589
Then we can move on to why
you didn't tell me that the guy

256
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:44,758
on the other side of this fight
used to be your associate.

257
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,710
- I was going to.
- When?

258
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:48,244
In 20 minutes, when you were
scheduled to be here.

259
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,679
Unfortunately,
I have to reschedule.

260
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:52,048
- Why?
- I have court.

261
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:53,183
Mike's alleging
I broke privilege.

262
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,185
- Did you?
- Yes, technically,

263
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,020
when I told you to move up
our timeline.

264
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,722
Now, if you'll excuse me.

265
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:01,591
W-wait a minute.
If you--if you broke privilege,

266
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:02,930
what are you gonna
tell the judge?

267
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,704
I don't know,
but until I think of something,

268
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:06,530
I'm going to confuse the shit
out of everyone I can.

269
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:08,281
That doesn't make any sense.

270
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:10,734
- It makes total sense.
- No, it doesn't, Your Honor.

271
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:12,319
All right, hold on.
Let me get this straight.

272
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,571
You work for him?
Worked. I was his associate.

273
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:16,072
Not the best associate,
Your Honor.

274
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:17,207
Is that relevant?

275
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,625
No, but I'd like it
on the record.

276
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,877
Well, it's on there now
whether we want it there or not.

277
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,246
And all I'm saying is, there's
no attorney-attorney privilege.

278
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,381
Finally, a fact.

279
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:25,382
An irrelevant fact,

280
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,750
because at the time
of the conflict,

281
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:28,585
I was his client.
Not the best client either.

282
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:31,054
Mr. Specter, shut up.
Now you're his client?

283
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:33,306
No, I was his client--
okay.

284
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:35,141
I was an associate
at Pearson Specter,

285
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:36,960
and then I left
to become an investment banker.

286
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:38,178
It's very confusing.

287
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:39,462
I'd dismiss the whole motion,
Your Honor.

288
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,982
I said, "shut up."

289
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,466
Are you an attorney
or an investment banker?

290
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:44,768
I'm an investment banker.

291
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,135
Then what the hell
are you doing in my chambers?

292
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:47,904
Acting as my own attorney.

293
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:50,240
And no matter how much he tries
to confuse the issue, he can't.

294
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,692
I told him I was going
after the same company he was,

295
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,694
and he used that knowledge
to move up his tender offer.

296
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:55,829
He waived conflict.

297
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:57,480
That doesn't apply
to privilege.

298
00:11:57,498 --> 00:12:00,083
Bottom line is, he doesn't
have proof of anything.

299
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:01,317
I don't, but he does.

300
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:03,987
Unfortunately,
he can't force me to testify.

301
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:04,988
There's no precedent.

302
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:07,007
Fortunately, there is.

303
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:11,511
So go ahead, ask him
if he did what I'm saying.

304
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:16,549
Mr. Specter,
do I need to swear you in?

305
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,435
Give him the T.R.O.

306
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:19,886
You know,
I'll do more than that.

307
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:22,522
Not only can't your client make
a tender offer for 60 days,

308
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:27,644
they can't purchase any more
stock until then either.

309
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:32,816
I'm telling you,
we need to negotiate with him.

310
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,117
You mean pay him off?

311
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,685
Yes, that's exactly
what I mean.

312
00:12:35,703 --> 00:12:39,522
Every day this drags on, it's
millions out of your pocket.

313
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,708
Well, from where I'm sitting,
all I can see is a lawyer

314
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:42,909
trying to distract me
from the fact

315
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,494
that this whole thing
is his fault.

316
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:45,862
If I didn't break privilege,

317
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,863
he might have locked
this whole thing up

318
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:47,864
before you knew
what hit you.

319
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:49,633
Fine.
We'll negotiate.

320
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:53,219
No, I'll negotiate.

321
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:55,171
No, not without me.

322
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:56,473
Do I need to draw you
a picture?

323
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:58,475
You, Mike, Rachel.

324
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,810
Harvey, I appreciate
your concern,

325
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,679
but this is my first deal, so
unless you're gonna pay him off

326
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:06,850
with your money,
I'm gonna be at that meeting.

327
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:12,656
What are you doing?

328
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,824
I'm writing in my diary.

329
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:16,776
Isn't that
what your dictaphone is for?

330
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:19,362
No, my dictaphone
is for my singular triumphs,

331
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:21,998
like when Harvey told me
I was the man,

332
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:25,752
and my diary is
for my most agonizing defeats,

333
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:28,571
such as when Jessica just told
me I'll never make name partner.

334
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,841
- Louis, she didn't say that.
- Well, she might as well have.

335
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,744
She just gave Malone
the corner office.

336
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:35,745
Oh, my God.

337
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:37,914
Yeah.

338
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:39,549
And what's more is
I think I agreed

339
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,184
to give him
Felton Securities.

340
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:43,920
Well, un-agree to it.

341
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,188
I can't.

342
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:47,090
I shook his hand.
The die is cast.

343
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:48,191
God damn it, Louis.

344
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,193
You know how this works.

345
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:51,644
First it's a case.
Then it's a client.

346
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:54,764
Before you know it, you're
on the 38th floor with Ted.

347
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:57,650
- Who's Ted?
- Exactly.

348
00:13:57,702 --> 00:14:00,937
Holy shit.
What did I just do?

349
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,372
I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

350
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:04,541
You're gonna stop writing
in that pussy diary,

351
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,710
and you're gonna show Jessica
you're the one

352
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:11,548
who should be sitting
in that corner office.

353
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:16,002
Ready the dictaphone.
We're gonna need it.

354
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,985
Hey. How are things
going Logan Sanders.

355
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:25,254
- You have no idea.
- Do I want to have an idea?

356
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:27,490
Not unless you want to hear
about how Mike Ross

357
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:28,841
is still
causing us trouble.

358
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,877
Nope.

359
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:33,763
You don't care about
Logan Sanders at all, do you?

360
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:35,548
No.

361
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:38,801
This isn't
a coincidental encounter, is it?

362
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:40,687
No, it is not.

363
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:43,056
You are having lunch
with Jeff Malone today.

364
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:44,524
Come on, Jessica.
You banged him.

365
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:45,858
The least you could do
is take him to lunch.

366
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:47,443
That is not funny.

367
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:49,678
Wait a second,
you want me to take him to lunch

368
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:50,846
because you banged him.

369
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:53,649
Harvey...

370
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,952
I want you to go ahead
and say "banged"

371
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:58,854
to my face one more time.

372
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,626
I'm not going to but not
because I'm scared of you.

373
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,163
Whatever lets you sleep
at night, white boy.

374
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,969
Donna, tell Paul Porter
he's meeting me for lunch.

375
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:15,538
When he gets there, tell them
to seat him with Jeff Malone.

376
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:16,973
Who's he not having
lunch with?

377
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:19,058
- Jessica.
- Oh, done.

378
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:21,094
Aren't you gonna ask me why?

379
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:22,895
She asked you to go
because she didn't want to.

380
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,014
You're sending Porter
because you don't want to,

381
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:27,517
but you didn't have the balls
to say no to her face.

382
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,518
Is that it?

383
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,019
The balls are debatable.

384
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:34,723
Balls are never debatable.

385
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:39,112
- Ah, hey there.
- Hey.

386
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:41,063
Louis, listen,
I just, um--

387
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:42,698
I just wanted to say
one more time

388
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,751
how much I'm really looking
forward to working with you.

389
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:46,919
Aww, well, I would just like
to say for the first time

390
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:48,204
that you will not be
working with me,

391
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,373
because I will not be giving you
my jock,

392
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,374
let alone my case.

393
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,176
Yeah.

394
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,743
Okay, I get it.

395
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:57,013
So you're the guy?

396
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:59,048
Yeah, I am the guy.

397
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,601
No, not that guy, Louis.
Definitely not that guy.

398
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:03,436
You're the guy in every office
who wants to piss

399
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,722
on the new guy, you know,
to mark your territory.

400
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,941
So why don't I just walk you on
down to my office?

401
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:11,137
I'm gonna let you get your
little piss on in my corner,

402
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:12,145
and then we can move on.

403
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:13,613
Oh, I've moved on.

404
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:15,431
I've set the deposition
for Todd Smith tomorrow.

405
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:16,783
You don't think
I know about that?

406
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:18,201
I don't give a shit
whether you know it or not.

407
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:20,703
It's my job to determine
whether Todd Smith is guilty.

408
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:22,857
And who do you actually think
is better at determining

409
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,658
whether a guy is guilty
of insider trading, Louis?

410
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,460
A career prosecutor
for the S.E.C.

411
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:29,212
or a monkey
in some Italian suit?

412
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:30,880
- [Chuckles] A monkey?
- Monkey.

413
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:32,882
Well, you're nothing
but a crowing cock.

414
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,717
And the last cock that walked
into my office

415
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,502
learned what
all the other cocks learned--

416
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:39,138
that I eat cock for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

417
00:16:39,173 --> 00:16:40,807
Louis, you're gonna let me
in that deposition tomorrow

418
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,008
whether you like it or not.

419
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,559
Why, because you're gonna run
to Jessica?

420
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:46,145
No, simply because I'm gonna
tell everyone here in the office

421
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,981
that you said you eat cock for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

422
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:51,734
Yeah, that's right.
It's goddamn delicious.

423
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:54,270
Mmm! Mmm, mmm.

424
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:57,907
[Barks]

425
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:59,661
So what, you think
you can handle Todd Smith

426
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:01,110
better than me?

427
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:04,080
Well, let's just see.
Let's just see what you got.

428
00:17:06,617 --> 00:17:08,651
Saw you scheduled a meeting
with Mike.

429
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:10,670
I assume that means you're going
to offer him a deal.

430
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:12,985
It could mean I'm going to
offer him a trip to Disneyland.

431
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:14,323
But it doesn't.

432
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:16,459
Of course not, he'd probably
want to wear mouse ears,

433
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,960
and then nobody wins.

434
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,128
You're welcome.

435
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:20,847
I didn't thank you.

436
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:23,042
Since you scheduled the meeting
when I'm at law school,

437
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,667
which you did to cut me out.

438
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,835
Did you get your name
on the wall since lunch?

439
00:17:26,854 --> 00:17:28,020
No.

440
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:29,305
Then let's get
something straight.

441
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,023
I didn't set that meeting.
Donna did.

442
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:34,393
And if I didn't want you there,
I'd just tell you to your face.

443
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:37,713
So let me tell you now, you're
not going to that meeting.

444
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:39,699
Because you think
I can't handle it?

445
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,701
Because I'm not throwing
gasoline on a pile of matches

446
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:43,119
just to see what happens.

447
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:45,404
Now, if you're done
wasting my time,

448
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:48,991
you just gave me an idea.

449
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,960
You're welcome.

450
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:57,967
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

451
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,168
You said it yourself.

452
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:01,036
I never brought you a gift
when you moved in.

453
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:04,240
- Still don't see an orchid.
- Flowers die.

454
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:07,210
I thought I'd bring
something better.

455
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:08,895
Me...

456
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:11,564
Across the table from you.

457
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:13,566
- Where's your client?
- He doesn't need to be here.

458
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,484
This fight started
with you and me.

459
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,153
So let's you and me
settle it right now.

460
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:19,388
You mean you don't want him
here because you don't think

461
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,157
Logan Sanders and I
can be in the same room.

462
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:22,992
I don't think.
I know.

463
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:24,110
Harvey, I'm a grown man.

464
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:25,745
I can sit across the table
from somebody

465
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,079
who had a history with Rachel.

466
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,748
Maybe, but you both
have a brain and a dick,

467
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,333
and if you get in that room
together,

468
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:33,402
the brains aren't gonna be
leading that conversation.

469
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,288
Fine, you tell me
that you have the authority

470
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:38,708
to negotiate a deal,
and I'll negotiate.

471
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,410
But you can't
'cause you don't.

472
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:43,879
And I'm not gonna agree
to something here today

473
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:46,081
just to have Logan reject it
tomorrow.

474
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,017
So go home, get some sleep,
and then the three of us

475
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:52,054
will do this again
in the morning.

476
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:59,140
Look, here's the thing Todd

477
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,069
You're not actually our client.

478
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:02,698
Felton Securities is.

479
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,833
And it's my job to find out
if you're telling the truth.

480
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,368
Bullshit.
It's my job.

481
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:08,870
- Louis, I'm handling this.
- No, you're not.

482
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,539
If he doesn't stop lying to me,
I'm gonna cut him looser

483
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,058
than Jared's pants
after a Subway diet.

484
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:15,227
- I'm not lying to you.
- You took a tip.

485
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:17,212
All right, Todd, you took a tip,
used it for your client--

486
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,681
Yes, and now you're trying--

487
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:20,849
God damn it, Louis!

488
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:23,084
Listen, if you don't back
the hell off my interrogation,

489
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:25,187
I'm gonna pick
his scrawny ass up

490
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,156
and use him to beat
the shit out of you!

491
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,440
Stop it!

492
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:29,441
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

493
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:32,528
You're trying to rattle me.

494
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:33,912
- Uh-oh.
- What?

495
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:35,331
Uh, your vein.

496
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:36,665
- Here?
- It's bulging.

497
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,083
Just like mine did,
right before my heart attack.

498
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:39,868
- Louis, he's not gonna--
- What? Have a heart attack?

499
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:42,404
That was exactly my thought
ten seconds before I was slumped

500
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:43,672
on the courtroom floor.

501
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:45,174
Oh, wow,
it's just like Jenkins.

502
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,259
- Jenkins?
- No shit, Jenkins too?

503
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:49,411
He was sitting
right next to me, hand to God.

504
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,347
And, Louis, you should have
seen his wife and kids

505
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:52,715
at the funeral.
Funeral?

506
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:55,417
- Yeah, you have kids, Todd?
- Yeah, I have two kids.

507
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:57,686
Yeah, well, whether it's
a heart attack or prison time,

508
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:59,555
if you do not stop
lying to us,

509
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,273
they're never going to see
their father again.

510
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:03,025
Do you understand
what I just said?

511
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,259
You are never going to play
soccer with them--

512
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:06,928
Okay.
Okay, I am lying to you.

513
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:08,597
But please,
you gotta help me.

514
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:09,931
Well, we want to.

515
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:12,534
But, T-dog, you gotta be
straight up with your homies

516
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:13,535
if you want us
to have your back.

517
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,105
The truth is,
I'm germaphobic.

518
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:19,074
I have to wash my hands
throughout the day.

519
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:21,577
And they get dry--
I mean really dry--

520
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:24,046
so I have to put on
a lot of lotion.

521
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,048
And I know
this sounds ridiculous,

522
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:27,783
but my finger must have slipped
on the keyboard, and I--

523
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:29,585
I hit the wrong stock.

524
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,970
You're saying that you didn't
even mean to buy that stock?

525
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,056
Nope, but then
it skyrocketed,

526
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,841
and I wasn't gonna tell
everybody that I only bought it

527
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,976
because I suffer
from dry skin.

528
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:39,961
Please, you can't
cut me loose.

529
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:43,432
I mean, I-I can't go
to prison.

530
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:46,735
Unsanitary.

531
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:52,658
Not that
it's any of my business,

532
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:53,975
but it was straight before.

533
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:55,143
I know.

534
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:56,829
Oh, I get it.

535
00:20:56,863 --> 00:20:59,865
Look less together.
Get underestimated.

536
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,917
[Chuckles]

537
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:06,288
You gotta wave
your hand slower.

538
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,658
- Thanks.
- No problem.

539
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:12,628
If you want soap, you just click
your heels together three times.

540
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:15,214
How do you think I'm planning
on getting that dryer to work?

541
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:16,548
You know, you think you wouldn't
have these problems,

542
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,999
considering what
you guys charge.

543
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:19,468
Oh, no, I don't work here.

544
00:21:19,502 --> 00:21:24,056
- But you, uh--
- I used to.

545
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:26,308
You're Mike Ross.

546
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:32,614
And you're Logan Sanders.

547
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,516
Paper towel?

548
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,986
Don't mind if I do.

549
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,521
After you.

550
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,790
- Don't mind if I do.
- I see you two have met.

551
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:43,125
We have.

552
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:45,627
And don't underestimate him
because of his tie.

553
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:50,215
I have always estimated
that tie correctly.

554
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,633
Now, can we talk
about business?

555
00:21:51,668 --> 00:21:54,536
Depends on what
you're proposing.

556
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:55,838
That you walk away.

557
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:57,673
That doesn't sound
like much of a deal.

558
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,174
Well, he forgot to add
the part where you walk away

559
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,260
$20 million richer.

560
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,011
Pure profit.
No risk.

561
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:05,213
Win-win.

562
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:08,183
[Clears throat]
All right.

563
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:12,905
Sounds good.

564
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:15,157
Guess I just have
one question.

565
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:17,493
What exactly are you going to do
with this company?

566
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:20,162
All due respect, I don't see
how that's any of your concern.

567
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:22,164
All due respect, you're the
one coming to me with an offer.

568
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:23,732
So if I say it's my concern,
it is.

569
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,752
Mike, you're asking about
a competitor's business plan.

570
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:28,537
And if he wants
to not be competitors,

571
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:30,672
then he needs to answer
my question.

572
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:32,073
Okay, I'll tell you.

573
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:35,911
I'm gonna do what anyone would
and sell it for parts.

574
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,430
[Chuckles]
No deal.

575
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:41,082
Okay, Mike.

576
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,218
You win.

577
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:46,254
Let's, uh,
make it 30 million.

578
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,556
You could make it
a billion, Logan,

579
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,358
and the answer is still
gonna be the same,

580
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:51,527
'cause I made a promise
to Walter Gillis

581
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,695
that I would fight
to keep his company alive.

582
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,281
And I don't think he's gonna
believe that cutting a deal

583
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:59,284
to sell his workers out
is keeping that promise.

584
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,619
I thought you said
he was smart.

585
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:02,454
I am, which I why I know
what's going on here.

586
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:04,907
What exactly is that?

587
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:07,659
No one ever
tells you no.

588
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,945
You're used to getting
what you want.

589
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:12,331
But that's gonna stop
right now.

590
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:15,918
You're right.
I do always get what I want.

591
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:17,219
I don't see how this time's
gonna be any different.

592
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:18,720
I'll tell you
how it's gonna be different.

593
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:21,223
This time you're talking about
something that I care about.

594
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:22,724
So if you think I'm gonna
step aside and let you do--

595
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,927
Yeah, I don't care
if you step aside or not.

596
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:27,346
When I see something I want,
I take it,

597
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:28,814
and then I do whatever the hell
I want with it.

598
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:31,800
And what I wanna do with
this company is strip it down,

599
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:32,851
flip it over--
Okay, that's enough.

600
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:33,969
No, no, no, let him talk.

601
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:35,320
I wanna hear this.
Keep going, Sanders.

602
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,355
No, I don't need to
because you know how this ends.

603
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:39,525
Yeah, I do, with me
and Walter Gillis on one side

604
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,443
and you crying to your daddy
on the other.

605
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:42,444
We're done.

606
00:23:42,478 --> 00:23:43,862
You're right.

607
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:46,748
We are.

608
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:49,317
Listen, the next time I say
"Don't come to a meeting,"

609
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:50,919
don't come to a meeting.

610
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:52,120
He came at me
just as hard as--

611
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:53,338
I don't give a shit
what he did.

612
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:55,340
Now, if you'll excuse me.

613
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,759
- Where are you going?
- To get you this company.

614
00:23:57,794 --> 00:23:59,595
- What are you talking about?
- Weren't you listening?

615
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:03,048
He just gave up
his weak spot.

616
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:06,635
Was that true
about Jenkins?

617
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:08,520
I don't even know
a Jenkins.

618
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:12,107
But I do know Todd's vein
wasn't bulging.

619
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,142
And, Louis, you were actually
pretty good in there.

620
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:16,344
Yeah, I was.
And so were you.

621
00:24:16,362 --> 00:24:17,729
So we're in agreement.

622
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,031
Yeah, you don't
completely suck.

623
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:21,149
I just meant that
we should stick by Todd Smith.

624
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:23,902
That story was so ridiculous,
it just might be true.

625
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:26,071
Great, I'll call Felton
and make the recommendation.

626
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:28,824
[Stammering] Well, hold up.
You're gonna do what now?

627
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:30,659
Call my client?
Louis.

628
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:32,828
It may be your client,
but it's still my case.

629
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:33,879
Like hell it is, Jeff.

630
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:37,049
- Okay. Okay, you call.
- Oh, I plan to.

631
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,383
And when I do,
I'll be telling them

632
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:40,168
that Mr. Slippery Fingers
is no longer our problem.

633
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:42,471
Just one second ago,
you said you believed him.

634
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:44,873
Yeah, I also told you that
his story was so ridiculous

635
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:46,308
and nobody would believe it.

636
00:24:46,342 --> 00:24:48,427
Well, then it's our job
to make them believe it, Louis,

637
00:24:48,478 --> 00:24:49,878
or this guy could wind up
in prison.

638
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,880
He is not my concern, Jeff.

639
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:54,483
Felton Securities is.

640
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:58,270
[Mutters]

641
00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:05,176
Walter Gillis knows
what he's doing.

642
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:06,328
Yeah, so do I.

643
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:07,913
He's letting your pension
go unfunded,

644
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:09,731
so he can hoard $1 billion.

645
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:13,585
No, that money is earmarked
for expansion into Asia,

646
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,087
and I believe
in Walter's vision.

647
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:18,239
You might, but do the workers
you represent?

648
00:25:18,257 --> 00:25:20,425
You're acting
as if our fund is empty.

649
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,628
I'm acting
as if it's 40% full.

650
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,347
And let me guess,
you're gonna fill up the rest.

651
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:28,583
Someone else wants to acquire
Gillis' company

652
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,418
before we can make an offer.

653
00:25:30,436 --> 00:25:32,187
If you vote to block it,

654
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:35,724
we will fully fund your pension
the day we take over.

655
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:40,112
You're talking about me
selling out my friend.

656
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:42,781
I'm talking
about $500 million.

657
00:25:42,815 --> 00:25:44,483
And why can you fund it
and they can't?

658
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,618
Well, they can with half
that billion, but they won't.

659
00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:49,437
Because like I said, he's
hoarding it for that pipe dream.

660
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:52,107
You're gonna take that billion
for yourselves.

661
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,575
Half.

662
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:55,494
The other half goes to you
and your union--

663
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:58,580
the men Walter Gillis
supposedly cares about.

664
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:02,050
Pete, this is gonna happen
whether it's me or someone else.

665
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:04,169
And someone else may not
give you the chance to do

666
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,255
what you were elected to do:

667
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:09,174
Protect your people.

668
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:16,857
Hey.
Hey.

669
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:22,371
How'd your meeting
with Harvey go today?

670
00:26:22,422 --> 00:26:25,124
I thought talking about work
was against the rules.

671
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:27,843
Mm, talking about work is.
Talking about our day isn't.

672
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,212
I mean, if we can't do that,
then we're letting the case

673
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:33,966
come between us, right?

674
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,935
My meeting with Harvey
went fine.

675
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,838
But you didn't take
the deal.

676
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:44,727
Because it wasn't
a good deal.

677
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:48,230
Fine.

678
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:50,482
Okay, what's the matter
with you?

679
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:53,535
What's the matter is that
I heard what happened.

680
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,372
- From him?
- No, from Donna.

681
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,023
But it could have been
from any of the 50 people

682
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,191
who saw the two of you
going at it.

683
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:00,826
- Rachel--
- Just tell me this.

684
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,162
Did you refuse the deal
because it wasn't good enough

685
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:04,696
or because it came from Logan?

686
00:27:04,714 --> 00:27:06,048
You think I didn't take
this deal

687
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,866
because of your history
with this asshole?

688
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:09,501
Well, you did
just call him an asshole.

689
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,536
He's an asshole because he's
willing to decimate a company

690
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:13,806
just to put some money
in his pocket.

691
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,808
Look, I gave my word
to Walter Gillis.

692
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,760
That's what I told Harvey
and what I told Logan

693
00:27:17,811 --> 00:27:19,478
and what I didn't think
I'd have to tell you.

694
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:24,650
I'm just saying, all of this
could have been over today.

695
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,901
You think I don't want this
to be over?

696
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,486
I do.

697
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,771
But I can't take that deal.

698
00:27:28,822 --> 00:27:31,156
And we said we wouldn't let this
come between us.

699
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,076
So don't.

700
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,197
- Hi, Donna.
- Hey, Louis.

701
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:39,564
What can I do for you?

702
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:45,370
Oh, well, I just came in
to bring you this and this

703
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:51,243
and all of these.

704
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:53,429
Those are the last seven
Todd Smiths you evaluated.

705
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,596
- Donna--
- Seven.

706
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,181
And you didn't cut
one of them loose.

707
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,383
- You heard me and Malone.
- I did.

708
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,852
And you're cutting this guy
loose just to spite him.

709
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,086
That's ridiculous.

710
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:03,439
Okay, so this has nothing
to do with Malone?

711
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,091
Nothing.

712
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:09,594
Where'd you get that?

713
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:11,697
Come on.
You know where I got it.

714
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,032
Louis...

715
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:18,270
I know he took your dream.

716
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:21,957
[Scoffs]

717
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,209
I mean, she didn't even
consider me.

718
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,128
Just brings him in,
had me train him,

719
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:30,466
and gives him
the corner office.

720
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,468
Hey, did I ever tell you
about the time that I auditioned

721
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,587
for <i>Hamlet</i> in college?

722
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:36,889
Obviously, you played Ophelia.

723
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,124
No, Chrissy Kiff did.

724
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:40,809
I was her understudy,

725
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,145
and I was so jealous.

726
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,681
I found myself wishing that
something would happen to her,

727
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:49,801
that she would get sick
or she would twist an ankle.

728
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:55,407
And then, the day
before we closed...

729
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:59,611
Her father died.

730
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:00,746
Donna, that wasn't
your fault.

731
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,532
But I still felt horrible

732
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:06,034
and ashamed

733
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:11,623
'cause my jealousy had brought
out something really ugly in me.

734
00:29:11,657 --> 00:29:16,328
And as you can tell,
I still regret that.

735
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:18,347
You know you've never
told me a story

736
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,183
about yourself
like that before.

737
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,603
I've never told anyone
that story before.

738
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,973
Louis, I know how badly
you wanted this.

739
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:33,362
But this is a man's life.

740
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,863
We won't cut him loose.

741
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,183
I'll tell Malone.

742
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:41,686
I'm proud of you, Louis.

743
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,378
Did you get an offer
to walk away from your takeover?

744
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,579
I did.

745
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,964
What was the offer?

746
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,332
$30 million.

747
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:55,801
And you turned it down?
What the hell is wrong with you?

748
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,202
They're gonna rip
the company apart.

749
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,087
I don't care if they wanna use
Walter Gillis' head

750
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:00,472
as a paperweight.

751
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:01,473
You said you wanted
a grand slam.

752
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:02,758
That offer is a double.

753
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:04,209
Well, I'd rather have a double
than nothing.

754
00:30:04,227 --> 00:30:05,210
Look, I know
what I am doing here.

755
00:30:05,228 --> 00:30:06,478
Do you?

756
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:08,146
Because they just
flipped the head of the union.

757
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,048
And without his vote,
we don't have shit.

758
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:11,883
- What?
- These guys play to win.

759
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:13,485
They just promised
$1/2-billion donation

760
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,937
to their pension fund.

761
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:18,907
And unless Walter Gillis is
gonna match it, we're done.

762
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,992
Yeah.

763
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,611
That's what I thought.

764
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:24,663
You get that $30 million,

765
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:28,166
or you find yourself
another job.

766
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:34,206
Donna,
did you need something?

767
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,626
No, but Louis does.

768
00:30:37,677 --> 00:30:40,128
He was planning to pitch you
that he take on Jeff Malone

769
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:42,014
before you and Harvey
even met him.

770
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,098
He saw Woodall coming
before we did?

771
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,383
And if he won,

772
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:48,053
he was hoping that
that would mean name partner.

773
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:50,305
I empathize with that, Donna.
I do.

774
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:51,423
But I have to make decisions

775
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:53,225
based on what's best
for the firm.

776
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:54,592
And I'm not here
to change your mind,

777
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:56,395
but maybe if you did
something else for Louis--

778
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:57,595
Such as?

779
00:30:57,614 --> 00:30:59,431
Giving him
the corner office.

780
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:01,199
You mean
Jeff Malone's office?

781
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,819
He could move to Louis'.

782
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,738
I appreciate
you letting me know about Louis,

783
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:08,106
but I'm not going
to do that.

784
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:09,408
Well, why not?
Jeff Malone just got here.

785
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:11,410
Because I said so.
Now if you'll excuse me--

786
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:13,245
You're sleeping with him.

787
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,630
- What?
- Of course.

788
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,416
That glow, the morning meetings,
you had Harvey take your lunch.

789
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,784
How could I miss it?
I'm losing my edge.

790
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:24,973
Donna, there is nothing
going on between--

791
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,976
you're not losing your edge.

792
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,146
But I ended my relationship
with Jeff Malone

793
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,298
the day that I hired him.

794
00:31:33,316 --> 00:31:34,733
And I respect that.

795
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,018
But you said
you make decisions

796
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:38,987
based on what's best
for the firm.

797
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:43,942
Isn't giving Louis his dignity
back good for the firm?

798
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:48,146
Hey, I got your message.

799
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:49,981
Usually when someone
wants to talk business--

800
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:52,668
I want to take your offer.

801
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:56,321
Mike, that offer's gone.

802
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:58,924
And what if I told you
I'd take less?

803
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,292
I'd say I can't
give you less.

804
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:01,760
Come on, you're the guy
who settles.

805
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,880
I'm telling you
I wanna settle.

806
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:06,765
You're telling me
you have to settle.

807
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,183
And I know that
you can get that offer back.

808
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,185
It's not my job
to get it back.

809
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,020
And even if it was, you think
he's gonna give you a nickel

810
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,689
after what you said to him?
What I said to him?

811
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,856
What about what he said to me?

812
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,191
I don't care what he said
to you.

813
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,309
I gave you a way out,

814
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:18,843
and you insisted
on going to that meeting.

815
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:21,062
You didn't do that for me.
You did that for your client.

816
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,699
What difference does it make?
It was a win-goddamn-win.

817
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,617
And you shit all over it.

818
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:26,868
Now I'm saying,
I'll take it.

819
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,353
Yeah, well,
it doesn't work that way.

820
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:29,988
I'm here as a courtesy.

821
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:32,023
You're only here
because you lost.

822
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:34,126
- Harvey, I'm--
- Enough.

823
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,496
That company's fate is sealed.
It always has been.

824
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,332
And the next time you walk away
from the table,

825
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:43,835
be prepared to walk away
from the table.

826
00:32:57,447 --> 00:32:59,915
Hmm.

827
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,031
Wanna pour me one of those?

828
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:04,837
Help yourself.

829
00:33:04,871 --> 00:33:07,823
So what's going on
with Mike Ross?

830
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:09,125
How do you know I'm thinking
about Mike Ross?

831
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:10,926
Who else would it be?

832
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:13,379
He got you on the ropes?

833
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,931
No, I got him.

834
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,833
And he's about to go down.
How do you know?

835
00:33:17,851 --> 00:33:19,468
'Cause the only way
to stay in the game

836
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:23,472
is to get Walter Gillis
to give up his dream.

837
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:25,274
And you don't think
he has the stomach

838
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:27,276
to rip off the arm
to save the body.

839
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,361
No, he doesn't.

840
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:31,313
You don't seem to feel good
about that.

841
00:33:31,347 --> 00:33:33,449
No, I don't.

842
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:36,685
Harvey.

843
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:38,704
Do you remember when I gave you
the Collins case?

844
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:39,955
Yeah.

845
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,575
It was brutal,
what we had to do.

846
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:44,693
It was my first taste
of that kind of thing.

847
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:46,361
And you loved it.

848
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:47,630
What's your point?

849
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:50,966
Some people love
the taste of blood.

850
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:54,003
Other people, hmm.

851
00:33:54,037 --> 00:33:57,039
Better to find out
who you are sooner than later.

852
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:58,591
You saying
I'm doing him a favor?

853
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:02,561
I'm saying,
you're being who you are

854
00:34:02,596 --> 00:34:07,149
and letting him
be who he is.

855
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:22,397
What are you doing?

856
00:34:22,415 --> 00:34:23,699
I'm just thinking
about how much

857
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,501
I'm going to miss
having my own office.

858
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:28,403
Put your pride away, okay?
You can still go back to Harvey.

859
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:29,738
I went back to Harvey.

860
00:34:29,756 --> 00:34:34,460
The money's off the table.

861
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:36,745
Then you have to flip
that vote.

862
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:39,048
The only way to do that
is to get Walter Gillis

863
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:43,252
to put $500 million
into that pension fund.

864
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,688
And if he does that,
he loses his expansion.

865
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:47,056
Mike, then do it.

866
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,425
Amy, when his son died,
this company became his family.

867
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:52,778
If he doesn't expand, then
his company's gonna die too.

868
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:55,064
I ask him to do that,
then I'm no better than Logan.

869
00:34:55,098 --> 00:34:56,899
No, you are better,
because after you do this,

870
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:58,450
you're still gonna fight
to keep them alive.

871
00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:00,069
Gillis is not gonna see it
that way.

872
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:02,204
He's just gonna see
some slick banker

873
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:04,039
who sold him a bill of goods
just to end up doing

874
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:06,909
what everybody else
was at least up front about.

875
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:09,411
Mm.

876
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:11,046
Then why don't you
just pack up your shit

877
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:13,132
and crawl out of here with
your tail between your legs?

878
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,718
Because if you don't have
the stomach to handle this,

879
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:20,139
then you don't belong here.

880
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:23,892
Hey, uh,
got your message.

881
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:25,344
Is there something wrong
with Felton Securities?

882
00:35:25,395 --> 00:35:26,345
Not at all.

883
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:27,846
Oh, thank God.

884
00:35:27,897 --> 00:35:30,465
I just assumed since you wanted
to meet here in Malone's office.

885
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:32,434
Oh, this isn't his office
anymore.

886
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:33,902
Oh, did he get fired?

887
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:36,989
No, but he is moving.

888
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:40,192
Louis, I know it hasn't always
been easy for you

889
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:42,695
to embrace new partners,

890
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:45,647
but you've made
a great effort with Jeff.

891
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:47,499
[Laughs]
All in a day's work.

892
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:51,203
And your day's work has
benefited this firm for years.

893
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:53,122
So we thought it was time
to show you

894
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:56,091
a little
overdue appreciation.

895
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:07,336
[Chuckles]
This office?

896
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:13,108
I gave this office to Jeff

897
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:15,861
because I wanted him
to feel valued here.

898
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:20,616
But the truth is, I--
I should have given it to you.

899
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,785
[Stammers]

900
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,820
[Groans]

901
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,290
I don't know what to say.

902
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:30,743
Oh, okay.

903
00:36:30,794 --> 00:36:33,412
All right, let it out.
[Sobbing]

904
00:36:33,463 --> 00:36:34,546
No way.

905
00:36:34,581 --> 00:36:36,298
Pete Kreeling would never side
with them.

906
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,883
He would, and he has,

907
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,368
because they offered
what you couldn't--

908
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:40,919
security for his workers.

909
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,051
They're my goddamn workers.

910
00:36:42,055 --> 00:36:43,972
Then show them
that you care about them.

911
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:46,208
Fund the pension,
and fund it now.

912
00:36:46,226 --> 00:36:47,726
You told me you'd fight
to keep this from happening.

913
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:49,681
I told you I would fight
to protect your company.

914
00:36:49,712 --> 00:36:51,730
And right now, this is
the best way of doing that.

915
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:54,400
You're talking
about using my expansion money.

916
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:55,434
If you don't use it now,

917
00:36:55,485 --> 00:36:57,236
there's gonna be
nothing to expand.

918
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,521
You son of a bitch,
you manipulated me.

919
00:36:59,555 --> 00:37:00,656
No, I told you
a war was coming

920
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,191
and that you needed
a war chest.

921
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:03,859
Well, now is the time
to crack it open.

922
00:37:03,893 --> 00:37:07,413
You told me what I wanted
to hear to get me on your side.

923
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:08,747
You're the same as them.
You're wrong.

924
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:10,699
I looked you in the eye,
and I told you that I wanted

925
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,234
to save your company.

926
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:13,335
They looked me in the eye

927
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,670
and told me they wanted
to rip it apart.

928
00:37:14,704 --> 00:37:16,205
You're the same as them!

929
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,257
And you're an naive old man
having a tantrum

930
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:22,077
because he's not getting
his way!

931
00:37:35,642 --> 00:37:38,861
That expansion
was my dream.

932
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:41,029
I know.

933
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:51,290
But now it's time to wake up.

934
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:54,710
Fund the pension, Walter.

935
00:37:54,744 --> 00:38:00,499
Pete Kreeling's vote
stays in our favor, and...

936
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,218
We live to fight
another day.

937
00:38:11,394 --> 00:38:12,811
No.

938
00:38:12,846 --> 00:38:15,597
I just wanted to thank you,
you know, for the new office.

939
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:16,631
It's a downgrade.

940
00:38:16,649 --> 00:38:18,400
Not to me.

941
00:38:18,435 --> 00:38:20,235
I also wanted to thank you
for lunch.

942
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,104
- I didn't show up for lunch.
- I know.

943
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:23,906
You thought you were
sending me a message.

944
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,240
I was sending you a message.

945
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:27,276
Not the one you wanted,
Jessica.

946
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,660
You see,
because what I heard is that

947
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:31,646
you don't trust yourself
around me.

948
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:34,333
If I didn't,

949
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:36,001
I wouldn't have put you
right next door.

950
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:38,487
Jessica, say what you will,

951
00:38:38,505 --> 00:38:40,255
but we both know
where this is headed--

952
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:43,158
you and me
watching these.

953
00:38:43,176 --> 00:38:45,660
You think you know me
that well?

954
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:47,329
Well, if I don't,

955
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:51,166
I'm about to.

956
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:53,185
Neighbor.

957
00:38:58,024 --> 00:39:02,277
More. More. More.
Ah, ah.

958
00:39:02,312 --> 00:39:04,696
Thank you.

959
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:13,906
Happy corner office.

960
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:16,792
Open it.

961
00:39:18,411 --> 00:39:20,162
- Is this...
- Me.

962
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:23,499
As Ophelia.

963
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:24,750
But I thought you--

964
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:27,636
Yeah, well,

965
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,557
sometimes bitter memories

966
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:35,394
become bittersweet

967
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:38,430
when you share them
with a friend.

968
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,852
- You here to pick up Rachel?
- No.

969
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:19,754
No, I just came by
to say thanks.

970
00:40:19,772 --> 00:40:20,973
For what?

971
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:25,694
For not giving me
a way out.

972
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:26,695
You funded the pension.

973
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:29,898
100%.

974
00:40:29,932 --> 00:40:31,984
You just got rid
of half your war chest.

975
00:40:32,035 --> 00:40:36,738
Maybe, but I also did
what you thought I couldn't do.

976
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:40,242
I got the vote back.

977
00:40:40,276 --> 00:40:44,997
Maybe now you'll realize that
I'm willing to go the distance.

978
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:46,164
All you did was make it
to round two.

979
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:47,466
Oh, so you thought

980
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,218
this was gonna be like
one of those early Tyson fights,

981
00:40:50,253 --> 00:40:54,122
the ones that only lasted
45 seconds.

982
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,173
Remember what happened
the first time

983
00:40:55,224 --> 00:40:57,225
someone made it
out of round one?

984
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,228
And what ever did happen
to Buster Douglas?

985
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:02,481
I don't know,
but wherever he is,

986
00:41:02,515 --> 00:41:05,601
they can't take that title away
from him.

987
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:17,145
Hey.

988
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:19,197
Hey.

989
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:21,166
What you working on?

990
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,985
You know what I'm working on.

991
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:25,320
You wanna go home?

992
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:29,091
[Cell phone vibrates]

993
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,543
Harvey.

994
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:34,963
Guess that means you're
gonna be working late, huh?

995
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:37,716
Um...

996
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,937
Thanks to the guy
we're up against.

997
00:41:41,971 --> 00:41:46,108
He is proving to be much tougher
than everyone expected.

998
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:48,860
- Everyone?
- Not everyone.

999
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:56,401
He sounds like
a real douche bag.

1000
00:41:56,452 --> 00:42:00,288
[Laughs]

1001
00:42:00,323 --> 00:42:04,409
You know,
he's not that tough.

1002
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,795
I can work on this tomorrow.

1003
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:10,832
Let's get out of here.

1004
00:42:14,671 --> 00:42:18,540
You really gonna
work on that tomorrow?

1005
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:20,375
No, I'm going to work on it
later tonight,

1006
00:42:20,393 --> 00:42:23,712
but at least I'll be home.

1007
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,213
Think I can take a look at it
when you're done?

1008
00:42:25,231 --> 00:42:26,214
I think not.

1009
00:42:26,232 --> 00:42:27,599
Just a proofread?

1010
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,386
Ah, still no.

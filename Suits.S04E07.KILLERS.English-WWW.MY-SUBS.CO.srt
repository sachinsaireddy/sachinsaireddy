00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:05,372
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:07,408
[Clears throat]

179
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:09,243
You want to give me--
a reward.

180
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:10,878
- Anything I want?
- All you have to do is ask--

181
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:12,880
Pearson, Specter, Litt.

182
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:14,181
- Excuse me?
- I think I was clear.

183
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,783
I want my name on the door.
It can go third.

184
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:18,452
Louis, named partner isn't
something I can just hand out.

185
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:19,586
But you just said
I saved the day.

186
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:22,056
You just said
you saved the day.

187
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,158
I said we wanted
to show our gratitude.

188
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:25,592
By telling me
I get to choose whatever I want,

189
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:27,161
except for the one thing
I really want.

190
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:28,395
Maybe I should have been
more clear.

191
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,596
Maybe you should have.

192
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:32,766
I mean, you're a goddamn lawyer,
after all.

193
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,068
Louis,

194
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:38,405
then let me be clear right now.

195
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,975
I am giving you an opportunity

196
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,145
to accept a well-deserved
thank-you with grace.

197
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,181
You can either take it,

198
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:49,383
or you can turn it
into a personal snub

199
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:52,019
and ruin all the goodwill

200
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:57,024
that you've just earned
with me and Harvey.

201
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:59,059
The choice is yours.

202
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:03,597
- Can I get back to you on that?
- I'm sorry. What?

203
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,031
Can I get back to you on that?

204
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:08,249
That's all I can hope for,
Louis.

205
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:13,818
Hey.

206
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:15,943
So I just wanted
to run through your schedule

207
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:17,011
for the rest of the week.

208
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:18,078
Mm, go ahead.

209
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:20,247
You've got Ellis
at 4:00 today,

210
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:22,082
McKinney at 10:00 tomorrow,

211
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:23,350
Chamberlain at 2:00,

212
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:26,520
and when should I pencil you in
to go see Mike?

213
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:28,922
- See him for what?
- To be a friend.

214
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,524
Donna,
as far as he's concerned,

215
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:32,259
I sold him out
to win the takeover.

216
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:34,194
I am the last person
he wants to see right now.

217
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,496
And I would agree
with all that,

218
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,232
except for the fact
that Mike got fired.

219
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,134
What?

220
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:41,602
When?
Last night.

221
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:42,770
And I wasn't gonna tell you

222
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:43,971
because you should be
hearing it from him,

223
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:45,139
but men are idiots,

224
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:46,774
and they would rather be
alone and miserable

225
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:48,042
than ever run the risk
of being accused

226
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:49,343
of needing someone.

227
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:50,611
He has Rachel.

228
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:51,779
Who is the one person
Mike believes

229
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:53,447
will stand by him
no matter what,

230
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:55,616
which makes her the one person
he won't believe

231
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,185
when she says
he didn't completely fail.

232
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,721
How important
is the meeting with Ellis?

233
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:01,955
He says it's urgent.

234
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,625
Tell him I have to reschedule.

235
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,861
That's weird.
I already did.

236
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,493
[Knocking on door]

237
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,841
Rachel or Donna?

238
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,509
Who told you to check up on me?

239
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:23,811
You don't think
I'd do that on my own?

240
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:24,878
No, I don't.

241
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:26,113
Well, I wouldn't have

242
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,587
because I didn't think
you'd need it.

243
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:30,751
Then I found out you got fired.

244
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:31,919
So what?

245
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:34,421
People lose their jobs
every single day.

246
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:36,423
Yeah, not people like you.

247
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,691
Something's going on.

248
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:38,725
Why'd you get fired?

249
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,881
You mean other than the fact

250
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:41,428
that I picked a fight
I couldn't win?

251
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:42,896
I don't care
how it turned out.

252
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:45,332
You went 15 rounds
on your first shot.

253
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:48,669
No way Jonathan Sidwell
lets you go after that.

254
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,540
It was Forstman, wasn't it?

255
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:56,276
I only got his money
if I agreed to cut Sidwell

256
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,312
out of the deal.

257
00:09:58,346 --> 00:09:59,880
And Sidwell found out.

258
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:01,515
He didn't just find out.

259
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:02,549
Forstman told him.

260
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,485
[Scoffs]
That son of a bitch.

261
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,686
Yeah, there's more.

262
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,855
That son of a bitch
has offered me a job.

263
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:10,357
Mike, you can't do it,
and you know it.

264
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:12,459
What choice do I have?

265
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:14,261
I was an investment banker
for ten minutes,

266
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:16,463
and I blew the only deal
I'm ever gonna get near.

267
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:18,866
Well, that sounds exactly
like the kind of bullshit

268
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,168
Forstman tells people
to wrap them around his finger.

269
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:22,870
- Doesn't mean it's not true.
- Yes, it does.

270
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:25,439
I could get you
five interviews before tomorrow.

271
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:26,640
And how are you going
to do that?

272
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,675
By making
five goddamn phone calls.

273
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,777
And what are you gonna say
when they answer?

274
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:31,945
You gonna tell them

275
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,514
I was a Harvard-educated lawyer
working for you?

276
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:34,648
Because you do that,

277
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:37,251
I might as well go back
to being a fraud.

278
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:39,419
[Sighs]

279
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:42,156
What if I can get Jessica
to take you back?

280
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,591
[Chuckles]

281
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:46,527
What if you could bring
my parents back to life?

282
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:47,694
Because both those things

283
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,630
have about the same chance
of happening.

284
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,498
- Mike, I'm trying to help you.
- And I appreciate that.

285
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:53,200
But I only have two references,
Harvey,

286
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:55,035
you, who has to lie for me,

287
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:56,570
and Jonathan,
who wants to kill me.

288
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:59,973
- Mike.
- Harvey, it's enough.

289
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,275
As much as you want to help me,

290
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,477
you have no idea what it is

291
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:07,381
to have been a fraud
and have to start all over.

292
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:10,017
I don't.

293
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,485
But someone else does.

294
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,935
Well, well.

295
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,706
If it isn't employee
number 7611053.

296
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
You still remember that.

297
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:27,908
I lied on my resume.

298
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:30,878
I never lied about having a head
for numbers.

299
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:34,882
I never said how sorry I was
for what happened to you.

300
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,383
You don't need to be sorry,
Mike.

301
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,652
The truth is,
I should be thanking you.

302
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:39,820
What?

303
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:41,688
You know what I do now?

304
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:45,125
Statistical analysis
for fantasy baseball.

305
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,860
That's awesome.

306
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:48,161
You don't know the half of it.

307
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:50,163
My old, better job,

308
00:11:50,198 --> 00:11:53,066
I sat in my office,
crunched my numbers,

309
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:54,568
made a lot more money,

310
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:56,870
barely knew the name
of one person on my floor.

311
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,673
Now my best friends
are people I work with.

312
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:02,075
[Chuckles]

313
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:06,580
Well, why'd you call me?

314
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:07,915
The last time I saw you,

315
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:09,349
you had no idea
what you were gonna do

316
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:12,419
with the rest of your life.

317
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:15,889
You had
to completely start over,

318
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,457
and it looks like you did.

319
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:19,626
I guess I--
want to know how.

320
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:21,895
[Sighs]

321
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,263
Start by starting.

322
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:25,065
What does that mean?

323
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:26,166
It means, for six months,

324
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,702
I threw myself
a giant pity party,

325
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:29,903
wondered how the hell

326
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:33,307
I was gonna get out
of the mess I was in.

327
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:35,375
And then one day
I said, "enough's enough."

328
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,544
And instead of asking questions,

329
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:40,647
I started looking for answers.

330
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:42,182
And you found
fantasy baseball.

331
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,351
No, I found out
that how much money you make

332
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:47,854
is not the most important thing
in the world.

333
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,458
Who you spend it with,
every day, is.

334
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:56,763
Thanks, Stan.
I appreciate it.

335
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:58,565
Whoa, Mike.

336
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,068
Why exactly is it
you need to start over?

337
00:13:01,102 --> 00:13:02,102
[Chuckles]

338
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:04,738
That's a long story.

339
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:06,974
I have time.

340
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:09,409
Another day, Stan.

341
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:13,080
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

342
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:14,247
Clear your schedule tonight.

343
00:13:14,282 --> 00:13:15,882
Done. Why?

344
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,651
Jessica offered me
anything I want

345
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:18,919
as a reward for my heroism,

346
00:13:18,953 --> 00:13:20,454
and we're gonna figure out
what that is.

347
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:22,255
What's to figure out?
Named partner.

348
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,558
No, not that.
Anything but that.

349
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:25,926
What do you mean,
"anything but that?"

350
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,661
There isn't anything but that.

351
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:29,016
Oh, you think
I didn't ask for it?

352
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,097
The words were out of my mouth

353
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:31,565
faster than Esther
when she was 13.

354
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,033
Louis, I don't care
about your slutty sister.

355
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,434
You deserve named partner.

356
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:35,602
And I don't care
that you don't care

357
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:37,537
because it's not gonna happen.

358
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,607
Now, we were given a chance
to take the high road,

359
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:43,644
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

360
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,345
If I were ever going to be
attracted to you,

361
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,347
now would be the time.

362
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:49,616
Instead I'll prepare a list
of demands befitting a hero.

363
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,018
Good.

364
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:52,719
And don't ever talk about being
attracted to me again.

365
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,121
It weirds me out.

366
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,192
[Phone ringing]

367
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:02,062
The answer's no.

368
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:03,463
You don't even know
what I'm here for.

369
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:05,065
I know
what you're not here for.

370
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,833
To tell me after a long night
of soul-searching,

371
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:08,301
you've decided to give me
full control

372
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:09,369
of Gillis Industries.

373
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:10,637
You're right. I'm not.

374
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:13,707
But I am here to give you
full control of this.

375
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:21,982
This isn't public information.

376
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:23,917
It will be in 24 hours.

377
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,352
So it's legal to give it to you.

378
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:26,787
And it gives me a 24-hour edge

379
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,689
if I decide to act
on this information.

380
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:30,590
Which, as you can see
from that filing,

381
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,826
would be
a very profitable thing to do.

382
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,128
And all I have to do in return
is use your law firm?

383
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:37,164
I don't care
what law firm you use.

384
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:38,231
I just want you to have
Mike Ross

385
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:39,366
run point on the deal.

386
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,567
Then we're back
where we started,

387
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:41,935
and you can get the hell
out of my office.

388
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,237
Jonathan,
I know what he did,

389
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:47,340
but he thought he had no choice.

390
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,776
When a person
thinks he has no choice

391
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,478
is when you see
his true character.

392
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,246
You think you have no choice

393
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:54,948
other than to be vindictive
right now.

394
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:56,750
This isn't vindictive.
It's common sense.

395
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:58,118
And where I come from,

396
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:00,520
you don't give the fox
another run at the henhouse.

397
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:02,222
You wouldn't have even had
a shot at the henhouse

398
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:03,490
if it wasn't
for him getting you out

399
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:05,158
from under Tony Gianopolous.

400
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:07,227
And I repaid him for that
by giving him his first shot

401
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:08,361
at investment banking.

402
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:09,396
And where I come from,

403
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,164
the way you really repay someone

404
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,667
is by giving them
a second goddamn shot.

405
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:17,037
Then go the hell back
to where you came from.

406
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:21,041
And, hey,
if you think he's so great,

407
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:22,476
take him back there with you.

408
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:32,185
[Knocking]

409
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,888
- Louis, you have a minute?
- Not really.

410
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:36,690
I'm in the middle of some
very important gift-choosing.

411
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:37,924
What?

412
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,292
Yeah,
wouldn't you like to know?

413
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,527
But you never will

414
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:42,062
because a person only gets gifts

415
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:44,197
when they fix the mistakes
that Jeff Malone's made.

416
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:46,833
Actually, Louis,
that's why I'm here.

417
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:49,002
I wanted to thank you
for catching that error

418
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:51,004
on the Wexler stock.

419
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:52,139
You want to thank me?

420
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:54,040
Yes, Louis, I do.

421
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:55,842
Look,
I know you don't trust me,

422
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:58,145
but you got us out of a jam,

423
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:00,447
and I'm here to thank you,
man-to-man.

424
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:01,848
Bullshit.

425
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,550
You're here to kiss my ass
because you found out

426
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,118
that I'm now above you
in the pecking order.

427
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:06,586
Louis, I don't care
about the pecking order,

428
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:09,422
and all I found out is that
you fixed this thing for Harvey,

429
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:11,658
and I am here to thank you.

430
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:13,126
I'm not talking about Harvey,
and you know it.

431
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,095
- No, Louis.
- Don't play dumb with me.

432
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,830
I'm talking
about Jessica Pearson,

433
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:18,732
the woman whose ass
you've really been kissing,

434
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:20,634
the very same woman
who came to me

435
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:23,203
and asked me to check your work.

436
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:26,773
Yeah, uh-huh.

437
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:27,941
Now, if you'll excuse me,

438
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:30,510
I have some Llipizzaner stallions
to look at.

439
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:42,656
You had Louis Litt
check my work?

440
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,658
I was wondering
when we might get into this.

441
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,526
Well, the wondering is over
because it's now.

442
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:48,562
And if you were going to do
something like that,

443
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,096
you should have discussed it
with me first

444
00:16:50,131 --> 00:16:51,565
before going behind my back.

445
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:52,966
I did discuss it with you,

446
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,335
and you stood right there
and said your work was perfect

447
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:56,603
and I should trust you.

448
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:57,904
You see,
that's the problem right there.

449
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,573
You don't trust me.

450
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:02,576
And now you're just rubbing
my mistake in my face.

451
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,544
If the goal
was to rub it in your face,

452
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,846
I would have done that already,

453
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,647
and we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

454
00:17:07,682 --> 00:17:09,649
In that case, maybe
we should keep our conversations

455
00:17:09,684 --> 00:17:11,351
on a professional level
for a while.

456
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:13,353
You're the one
who wanted to do both.

457
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:15,555
And maybe I was wrong.

458
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,825
I never said
I didn't trust you.

459
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,294
I said I didn't trust
your work on Wexler.

460
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,598
That's the difference
between us, Jessica.

461
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:26,933
You see, when I say, "trust me,"

462
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:29,469
I mean trust the man
who works for you

463
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,238
and the man that's with you.

464
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,783
You wanted to see me?

465
00:17:43,818 --> 00:17:45,018
You don't seem in a good mood.

466
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:46,753
I'm not.

467
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:47,868
We can talk about it later.

468
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:49,289
I walked
all the way down here.

469
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:50,891
We can talk about it now.

470
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:53,693
I was just gonna ask
how Louis' talk went.

471
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:55,161
Bullshit.

472
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,437
That is not an "I have to come
talk to you" conversation.

473
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:06,373
I want to bring Mike back.

474
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,074
[Chuckles]

475
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:10,043
That is not a conversation
I ever want to have.

476
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:11,077
Jessica--

477
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:13,046
Harvey, I haven't slept better

478
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,547
since his last night,

479
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:16,516
except for every night since,

480
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,918
and I'm not going back.

481
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,986
In case
you really were wondering,

482
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:22,956
Louis took his thank-you
like a dick.

483
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,325
And if that's all,
I'm going home.

484
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:37,237
[Door clicks and squeaks]

485
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:38,672
[Door thuds]

486
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:39,806
Hey.

487
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,975
Hey.

488
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:44,144
Are you cooking?
Mmm.

489
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:45,245
I make one thing,

490
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,881
and I make it awesome.

491
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:51,384
Mike, every single guy
thinks that his spaghetti sau--

492
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:57,624
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

493
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:01,394
Not every single guy
was raised by his grandmother.

494
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,431
Now you sit down, shut up,

495
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:07,400
and tell me about your day.

496
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:09,769
What got you
in such a good mood?

497
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:10,804
Oh, you know, nothing.

498
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,105
Just spent the afternoon

499
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:13,974
figuring out what I'm gonna do
with my life.

500
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:15,842
Well, that sounds
like quite the afternoon.

501
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:18,445
What did you figure out?

502
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:22,449
Well, I figured out
I don't want

503
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:24,050
to take the job with Forstman,

504
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:28,388
and I don't want to be
an investment banker.

505
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,991
So what do you want to be?

506
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:32,092
I don't know.

507
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:37,197
But I know
I want to be with you.

508
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:41,034
- What are you saying?
- I want to start over.

509
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:42,235
I don't understand.

510
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:43,336
Rachel, when I met you,

511
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:44,604
I had nothing in my life

512
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:47,974
except what came
from being a fraud.

513
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,577
And now I have nothing in it
except being with you,

514
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:52,579
and I wouldn't go back
even if I could because...

515
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:53,747
Mike--

516
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:56,983
I don't care
what I do for a living.

517
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:58,318
I mean, I'll figure it out,

518
00:19:58,352 --> 00:20:01,021
but as long as I have you,

519
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:04,457
I have everything.

520
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:07,293
Rachel?
[Sobbing]

521
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:09,095
What--
I didn't mean to make you cry.

522
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,897
I meant to make you
feel better.

523
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:12,899
Hey, hey,
everything's going to be okay.

524
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,602
- No, it's not.
- Rachel, what's wrong?

525
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:16,936
I'm sorry.
I just need a minute.

526
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:18,571
- Rachel.
- I just need a minute.

527
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:20,407
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
I'm right here. You can tell me.

528
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:22,242
What's going on?
I can't.

529
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:23,910
Rachel, stop.
Yes you can.

530
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:25,478
Hey, hey.
No, you don't-

531
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:27,680
I don't deserve you.
- What are you talking about?

532
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:29,482
Rachel, hey--
Logan and I kissed.

533
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:33,453
What?

534
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:35,555
We were just talking,

535
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:37,123
and then he--

536
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:38,491
He what?

537
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:40,093
Mike, please.

538
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,694
I am so sorry.

539
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:43,296
Mike, no, please.

540
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,965
[Sobbing]

541
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,668
Please, it didn't mean anything.

542
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:49,903
Wait.

543
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:51,738
[Door rattles and slams]

544
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,640
[Sobbing] I'm...

545

[Grunts]

547
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,493
This is how you handle losing?

548
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,261
I'm not here
about Gillis Industries.

549
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:13,329
Ooh, you gonna fight me?

550
00:21:13,363 --> 00:21:15,965
You stay the hell away
from Rachel.

551
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:18,367
Well, that's up to her.

552
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,569
But if she does come back here,

553
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:21,337
it won't be to tell me
to stay away.

554
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:23,806
[Grunts]

555
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,742
[Both grunting]

556
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:27,777

557

559
00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:33,716
Ah!

560

[Panting]

563
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:50,333
I don't know what she told you.

564
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,768
[Panting]

565
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:54,737
But she let it go on
a long time.

566
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:00,810
And she didn't just like it.

567
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:03,179
She loved it.

568
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,387
You told him.

569
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:13,589
I don't even know where he is.

570
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,825
He's at Harvey's.

571
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,593
How do you know?

572
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,195
Where did you go?

573
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:27,970
Forstman?

574
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:29,271
Logan.

575
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,807
Gillis.

576
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:33,576
Rachel.

577
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,245
Get the hell in here.

578
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,682
I never should have told him.

579
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:42,451
Rachel,
there's no use thinking that.

580
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,656
What if he doesn't forgive me?

581
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,890
You don't know that he won't.

582
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:49,992
You don't know that he will.

583
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:51,093
And you're the one that said,

584
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:53,162
"this will bore a hole
in his head."

585
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:54,864
And you're the one who said
you had to find a way

586
00:22:54,898 --> 00:22:57,366
to trust him with the truth.

587
00:22:57,401 --> 00:22:58,567
He walked out.
I can't just--

588
00:22:58,602 --> 00:22:59,669
Stay here tonight?

589
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:01,270
Of course you can.

590
00:23:03,823 --> 00:23:05,123
I'm not going back there.

591
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:06,424
I'm not saying you have to.

592
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm saying
you need to calm down.

593
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:10,128
Would you calm down
after someone

594
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:11,529
stuck it in your face like that?

595
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:14,566
I would if I knew he was just
trying to get in my head.

596
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,534
How the hell do you know
that's all it is?

597
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:19,037
Because that piece of shit
did it to you before,

598
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:20,572
and I let him
because I'm his lawyer,

599
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:22,040
but I'm not gonna let him
do it to you now.

600
00:23:22,074 --> 00:23:23,475
Yeah, well,
he got in my head.

601
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,376
He put the image in there,
and now I can't get it out.

602
00:23:25,411 --> 00:23:26,544
Mike--

603
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,779
Look, I need to know
if it's true.

604
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:29,748
And what good
is gonna come of that?

605
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:35,787
I just need to know.

606
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:37,956
Then there's only one way
to find out.

607
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,824
But you're not gonna find out
tonight.

608
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,093
Here.

609
00:23:59,478 --> 00:24:01,179
Mike.

610
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:02,981
Oh, my God, I was so worr--

611
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:08,753
Oh, my God, your face.
What happened?

612
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:11,756
You know what happened.

613
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,159
You went to see Logan.

614
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:15,593
I want you to tell me
exactly what happened

615
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:19,197
between you and him.

616
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:21,099
Okay, why don't we just
go home right now,

617
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:22,613
and we can talk
about all of it there?

618
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:24,803
You're gonna tell me
what happened right here.

619
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,538
Mike, I--

620
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:27,739
I need to know
that I can trust you,

621
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:29,040
because you said

622
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:30,441
that it didn't mean anything,
but he said--

623
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:33,945
- Mike, please.
- Did it mean something or not?

624
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:36,281
It meant something
when it happened, but now--

625
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,082
Okay, look.
Okay.

626
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:39,584
I made a huge mistake,

627
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:40,885
but you just asked
if you could trust me--

628
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,620
Trust you?

629
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,289
You didn't tell me about this
for a week,

630
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:45,884
and then when you finally did,
you lied.

631
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:47,292
I didn't lie.

632
00:24:47,326 --> 00:24:48,827
You walked out before I could
tell you the whole story.

633
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:50,328
The whole story?

634
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:51,930
There's no way you were going
to tell me that whole story.

635
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:54,999
- Mike, please.
- He said that you loved it!

636
00:25:02,074 --> 00:25:03,274
And when I said
that it didn't matter

637
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:06,044
what I'd do next
because I have you?

638
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:09,848
I was wrong

639
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:11,182
because we're done.

640
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,699
Ohhhh, it is busy.

641
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:27,976
Okay, listen, Rachel.
When you are done can you just--

642
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,244
Holy shit, are you?

643
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,280
No, I'm not.

644
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:33,515
So help me, if Harvey
mistreated you, I will--

645
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,550
It wasn't Harvey, Louis.

646
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:35,918
It's Mike.

647
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,319
That son of a bitch.
Where is he?

648
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:39,821
Because I'll--
it wasn't him. It was me.

649
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:43,659
Rachel.

650
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:46,895
Look, I know
that he hurt you with Sheila,

651
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,231
but I love him,

652
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:50,566
and I lost him.

653
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,800
And I don't really know
what to do.

654
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:54,436
Oh, come on, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

655
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,406
listen to me right now, okay?

656
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,241
Whatever I may think of Mike,

657
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:02,344
I have no doubt
that he loves you.

658
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:05,581
And when two people
love each other,

659
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:09,418
no problem is insurmountable.

660
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:11,920
That's bullshit.

661
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:14,656
And you of all people know it.

662
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:15,924
What?

663
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,559
You and Sheila
loved each other,

664
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:19,628
and you still broke up,

665
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,732
even though neither of you
had done anything wrong.

666
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:25,233
That's different.

667
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:27,769
Did you hear me?

668
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:30,005
I did something wrong.

669
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,840
And now he doesn't trust me,

670
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:36,111
and I can't make him
trust me or forgive me.

671
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:39,548
So it doesn't matter
how much I love him, okay?

672
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:41,016
Becau--

673
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,584
Okay, all right, listen.

674
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:45,287
Rachel, you have so much
going for you.

675
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:48,890
It's gonna be okay.

676
00:26:48,925 --> 00:26:50,525
And what good is any of it

677
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,462
if I don't have the one person
I want to share it with?

678
00:27:06,743 --> 00:27:08,143
Logan,
what are you doing here?

679
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:12,414
You told Mike after you
explicitly told me not to.

680
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:15,951
I don't have
to explain myself to you.

681
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:18,453
- Really?
- I didn't mean for it--

682
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:20,422
It doesn't matter what you did
or didn't mean to happen.

683
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:21,556
It happened,

684
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:22,691
and I know why it did.

685
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,126
What are you talk--

686
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,063
You told him
because deep down inside,

687
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:29,197
you want to be with me,

688
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,565
and you knew this
would make it happen.

689
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,767
That is bullshit.

690
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:32,901
Really?

691
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:35,337
Because that is exactly
what you said to me

692
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:37,039
when I told Allison about us.

693
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,440
That has nothing
to do with this.

694
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:39,474
Rachel.

695
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:40,609
And since
you obviously came here

696
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:42,244
to find out where it is
we stand,

697
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:44,279
let me tell you.

698
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:45,814
There is no us.

699
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:48,016
There will never be an us.

700
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:51,420
And no matter what happens
between me and Mike,

701
00:27:51,454 --> 00:27:52,854
this is the last time

702
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:55,290
that you and I are ever gonna
have a conversation again.

703
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:58,026
- You're my lawyer.
- Not anymore, Logan.

704
00:27:58,061 --> 00:27:59,761
So whatever real or fake meeting
you have with Harvey,

705

to make him take that offer back

is to force him to do it

918

again and again.

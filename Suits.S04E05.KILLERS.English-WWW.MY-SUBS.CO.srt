It's not Woodall
coming after us.

It's--
Sean Cahill.

Welcome to the new S.E.C.

- Mr. Forstman.
- No.

00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:13,550
You'll miss the opportunity
to get back at Harvey Specter.

7
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:15,018
You've got my 230 mil.

8
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:18,388
Once the deal closes,
you cut Sidwell out.

00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:20,940
What happened to "You think
I'm staying if you leave"?

10
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,025
Yeah, that was before I knew

11
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,443
you were gonna
screw over Sidwell.

12
00:00:23,477 --> 00:00:24,978
Forstman doesn't throw
money around

13
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:26,512
without getting something
in return.

14
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,864
I have no other choice!

15
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:30,349
So we're just gonna go
back and forth trading favors?

16
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:31,985
Are you my lawyer or not?

17
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:35,488
Seriously, Rachel, I couldn't
have done it without you.

Right here.

22
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:03,316
- Did you turn off my alarm?
- I did.

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,684
It's after 9:00.

24
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:05,685
I have been sleeping for--

25
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,770
Almost six hours.

26
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:07,821
I know.

27
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:09,022
And the truth is,
you need more.

28
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:10,273
Why would you do that?

29
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:11,858
Rachel, you've been
running back and forth

30
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:13,532
between school and the firm
like a maniac.

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,577
I don't even remember
the last time

32
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:15,862
you got a good night's sleep.

33
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:17,330
It doesn't give you
the right to do that.

34
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:18,748
Plus, Harvey's gonna kill me.
He'll get over it.

35
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:19,949
And I've got three briefs
to write,

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
plus a paper for torts

37
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,203
and a contracts exam tomorrow.

38
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:24,704
I don't have the luxury
to sleep in.

39
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:27,540
Then you need to ask Harvey
for a day off this week.

40
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:30,343
Did he ever give you time off
because you were overworked?

41
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:34,080
- No, he didn't.
- Exactly.

42
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:38,551
I don't want to be
any different.

43
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:40,804
Mr. Jamieson,
you are hereby remanded

You might want to call me
about an appeal.

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,102
The prosecutor has a reputation
for bending the rules.

48
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,604
You must be
the infamous Harvey Specter.

49
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:01,574
And you must be the chump
Eric Woodall ordered

50
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:02,826
to come after me.

51
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:04,294
Chump's my name
on my mother's side.

52
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:05,462
I do prefer Cahill.

53
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:07,130
And I prefer you stop
manufacturing bullshit

54
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:08,548
to get my clients
to turn on me.

55
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,783
I'm sorry, I'm not in
the manufacturing business.

56
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,552
I'm just a humble civil servant.

57
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:13,953
And if you're as clean
as you say you are,

58
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:15,588
your clients won't have anything
to give us.

59

Unless you bully them
into making things up.

Oh, see, now I think
you've got us confused,

61
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:20,643
because that sounds like
something that you might do.

62
00:02:20,678 --> 00:02:23,229
The point is, Sean,
you had a secret little plan,

63
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:25,431
and I've taken away
your element of surprise.

64

but do you know
where or when?

See, while you're battening down
the hatches at B-4,

68
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:33,907
I might be at D-12 or H-3,

69
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:37,193
and before you know it,
I have sunk your battleship.

70
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,644
That's a cute game.

I was more of a rock 'em
sock 'em robots guy.

72
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:44,117
So you think you can knock
my block off, Harvey?

73
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:47,337
I know I can, because I had
Eric Woodall fired.

74
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:49,488
So stay the hell away
from my clients,

75
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:52,876
or I'll pave
the same career path for you.

76
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:55,929
Okay, your hands weren't full
with Eric.

Mike, if you feel this way now,

what are you gonna feel like
when you cut Sidwell out?

00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:20,620
If I cut him out.

What are you talking about?

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,323
I've been thinking about it.

87
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:26,960
I haven't actually
taken Forstman's money yet.

88
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:29,546
If I can get Harvey
to back off before I do,

89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,414
then I might not even need it.

90
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:33,833
You want to use the idea
of Forstman's money

91
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:34,867
to cut a deal.

92
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:37,170
But, Mike, they have money too.

93
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:39,505
Yeah, which they can't spend
until their T.R.O. expires.

94
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:41,307
Yeah, but that's next week,
and it's not like

of shares available now.

two of their funds.

So their investment parameters
don't allow

99
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:00,063
for more than 4%
of their holdings

a block of something.

But how do you know
it's gonna be Gillis Industries?

103
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,502
Because I did the math.
That's what I would do.

will go for it?

to find out.

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,385
- No, you're not.
- Jessica, we have to--

173
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:46,770
I'm not saying we don't.

174
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:50,023
I'm saying I'm going to be
the one to do it.

175
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,191
You know
he's not gonna like it.

176
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:52,776
He doesn't have to like it.

177
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,944
He has to do it.

178
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,115
Therefore, prepare thee
to cut off the flesh.

179
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,019
Shed thou no blood,
nor cut thou less nor more.

180
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:05,905
But just a pound of flesh if--

181
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:09,025
Louis, how long have you been
standing there?

182
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:10,794
Long enough
to become part of you.

183
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:12,195
Okay, you know what?

184
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:13,663
I don't have time
for you to be creepy.

185
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,198
So does this mean
you're doing theater again?

186
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:16,883
Yes, I am playing Portia
in <i>merchant of Venice.</i>

187
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,051
Now, can you please just
let me get back to--

188
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:19,836
Holy shit, Donna,
that is a meaty part.

189
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,223
Yeah, it's 588 lines,
which I have yet to memorize.

190
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:24,257
Wait.

191
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:25,258
So you're not off book?

192
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,676
Louis, if I were off book,

193
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,144
would I be pacing around
the copy room

194
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:29,179
with a script in my hand?

195
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,220
All right, just calm down.

196
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:31,231
No need to panic.

197
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:32,315
When do you open?
Tonight.

198
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:33,683
Tonight,
and you're not off book?

199
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:34,934
What the hell's wrong with you,
Donna?

200
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:36,052
- Okay, this isn't helping.
- I'm sorry.

201
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,187
I didn't mean to be--
I knew it.

202
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,405
I bit off
more than I could chew.

203
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,323
No, no, no, no, no, no,
just relax, okay?

204
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,574
I don't care
if it takes all day.

205
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:45,028
We are gonna memorize
these lines together.

206
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:47,330
- Thank you, Louis.
- No need.

207
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,165
For one canst choke
on the joy of life

208
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,750
without thy mouth full.

209
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:52,252
Is that the bard?

210
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:53,286
Nope, it's the Litt,

211
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:55,171
and roughly translated,
it means,

212
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:58,708
when we're done, you're gonna
kick Shakespeare's ass.

213
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:03,379
Milady.

214
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:08,268
I take it
it didn't go well.

215
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:09,686
What gave it away?

216
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,354
Because I know you,
and you don't have your usual

217
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:14,307
"I'm super cool Mike Ross"
face.

218
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:15,424
If you knew me that well,

219
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:18,728
you'd know
I'm not in the mood.

220
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:19,946
Mike, I'm not your enemy,

221
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,483
and I don't appreciate
being treated like I am.

222
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:24,534
I know.

223
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:26,703
I'm sorry.

224
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,288
So what did Harvey say?

225
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:29,883
It's not what he said.
It's what he did.

226
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:31,991
He knew what I was trying to do,

227
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:33,793
and he called my bluff
right there.

228
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,945
He didn't even share the offer
with Logan?

229
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:36,963
No, he didn't.

230
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:38,047
But you said he had to.

231
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:39,883
You want me to sue him
for that?

232
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:41,000
So what are you gonna do?

233
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,085
You know what I'm gonna do.

234
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,470
- Mike.
- I don't want to hear it.

235
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,054
I wasn't disapproving.

236
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,457
I just want to make sure you've
exhausted all your options.

237
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:49,976
- I have.
- Then maybe you can--

238
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,395
Amy, the second I bid
on that block of shares,

239
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:53,963

I'll tell him.

Sidwell?

244
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:05,942
He wants to see you.

245
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:16,152
You look good.

246
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:18,004
This isn't a social call.

247
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:19,789
All right,
I take it back.

00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:21,090
Wexler is divesting

249
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,759
a huge block
of Gillis Industries,

250
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,511
and I need you to find
a creative way

251
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:25,962
to buy them for Logan Sanders.

252
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,298
If I'm not mistaken,
Logan Sanders has a T.R.O.

253
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:30,967
that actually prohibits him from
buying any additional shares.

254
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,218
Which is why
you're going to set up a trust

255
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:33,353
for us to buy it for him.

256
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:34,837
That's called parking,
Jessica.

257
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:36,022
I know what it's called.

258
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,607
Then maybe you also know
it's illegal.

259
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:39,342
I know it can be illegal,

260
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,811
and I need you to figure out
a way to make it questionable.

261
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,512
And here I thought
you came in here

262
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,681
to tell me how much fun
last night was.

263
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,534
Oh, speaking of last night,

264
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,685
you said you blamed yourself

265
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:53,156
for helping Cahill
drop those cases.

266
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,375
So here's your chance
to make up for it.

267
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:56,525
Remind me never to have

268
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:58,461
a moment of self-reflection
around you.

269
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,997
I'm not using this
as ammunition.

270
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:02,698
I am using it as motivation.

271
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:05,552
So figure out a way
to set up the trust,

272
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:06,702
and do it quickly,

273
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,173
because we're running
out of time.

274
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:21,050
You wanted to see me?

00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,068
Come here.

276
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:24,771

Lionsdale Electronics,
3 million shares,

bought out by management.

279
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:37,834
My first LBO.
I was right out of school.

280
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:40,336
All I wanted was that first
tombstone because it meant--

281
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:44,740
- Your first deal.
- Broke my cherry.

282
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:45,758
Must have been nice.

283
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,911
It was.

284
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:51,097
But you know what the difference
between you and me is?

285
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:52,215
I was just an analyst.

286
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:53,433
I mean, sure,
I did all the work,

287
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,601
but I didn't do any of the work.

288
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:56,185
Know what I mean?

289
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,637
- Jonathan.
- Don't be modest.

290
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,055
I know I've been on your case,

291
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,108
but the truth is,
you made this all happen.

292
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:04,110
I haven't made
anything happen yet.

293
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:06,095
No, you haven't.

294
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:09,616
And there's a rule against
giving out tombstones too early.

295
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,601
You're not
supposed to jinx it.

296
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,954
But there's no rule
against this.

297
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:16,990
We'll fill it in later.

298
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:23,663
Thank you, Jonathan.

Yes, you can help

how much longer it's gonna take

00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:14,349
for you to find me a way
to bid on that stock.

as long as it takes.

Well, it better not be
more than a day,

312
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:20,021
or I won't need it at all.

313
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,824
It's so good to hear this
from the horse's mouth.

What's that supposed to mean?

315
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:26,278
It means the next time
you want me to break the law,

316
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,029
at least have the balls
to ask me yourself.

317

First off, Jessica insisted
on asking you herself,

319
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,753
and I agreed with her,
because we're on the same page.

320
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,538

to break the law.

00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,669
No, really, what can I do
to make your life easier?

347
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,004
That is not fair.

348
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,122
I have been juggling work
and school for months now,

349
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,591
and I-I haven't asked
for any special treatment.

350
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,259
You're asking now.

351
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:32,811
I'm not asking for time off

352
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,095
to go to the Hamptons.

353
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,897
This is law school
I'm talking about.

354
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,065
You said a day away.

355
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:38,433
You didn't say anything
about law school.

356
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:39,507
Well, it's for law school.

357
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,236
Well, this is your law school.

358
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,438
This, right here.

359
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,156
And by the way,
we're paying you for it.

360
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,775
I know,
and I'm grateful.

361
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,827
If you're grateful,
then you'll stop complaining

362
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,412
about how much work
you have to do,

363
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,197
and you'll figure out
how to best manage your time,

364
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,000
but as far as getting time off,
that's not gonna happen

365
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,434
if you still plan on
working for me.

366
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:58,253
Now, you still need
a day or two off?

367
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,622
No, I can manage.

368
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,548
Thou shalt have nothing
but the forfeiture

369
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,167
to be so taken
at thy peril, Jew.

370
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,136
Why, then, let the devil
give him good of it.

371
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,940
I'll stay no longer question.

372
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,275
Come on, let's go.
This be-eth awesome.

373
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:21,526
Where's your script?

374
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,111
I don't need a script.
I'm off book.

375
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:24,863
How can you be off book?
You're not even in the play.

376
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,115
Because I know
all of Willy's work by heart.

377
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,351
- All 37 plays?
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,653
<i>Troilus and Cressida.</i>

379
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:34,990
For to be wise and love
exceeds man's might.

380
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:36,207
<i>Titus Andronicus.</i>

381
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,827
Vengeance is in my heart,
death in my hand.

382
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,546
Blood and revenge
are hammering in my head.

383
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
What--what's the matter?

384
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,000
Are you kidding me?

385
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:47,719
You have every word this man's
ever written memorized,

386
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,920
and I'm on
in an hour and a half,

387
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,371
and I'm gonna
make a fool of myself.

388
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:51,806
Donna, forget
about my extraordinary gift

389
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,091
and focus on yourself.

390
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,726
We have done this whole play.

391
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,678
You know your part.
It will be fine.

392
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:59,647
- It's not gonna be fine.
- Donna.

393
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:01,316
I haven't been on the stage
in years.

394
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,684
So you're nervous.

395
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,353
All great performers
get nervous.

396
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:06,855
It brings out the genius.

397
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,607
What if I'm not genius?
What if I'm not even good?

398
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:16,081
I was pretty damn good, Louis.

399
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,067
I was.

400
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,735
But I knew the odds
of somebody making it

401
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,040
were close to zero
no matter how good they were.

402
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,258
My father lost our money
when I was 13,

403
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,912
and I-I found out
what it was like to struggle,

404
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,101
so instead
of pursuing my dream,

405
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,520
I chose this...

406
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,639
And that let me pretend

407
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,893
that maybe I was good enough
to make it.

408
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:51,149
But what if I wasn't?

409
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,367
Mm-mm, all right, look,

410
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:53,735
I'm gonna tell you
something about myself

411
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,771
that I never told anyone.

412
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,324
I have stage fright.

413
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,159
Got it when I was
in third grade.

414
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,129
Let it get the best of me.

415
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,082
I never got over it.

416
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:10,552
And I cannot let you
make the same mistake.

417
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:14,589
- But--
- Look at me.

418
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:18,292
Donna Victoria Paulsen,

419
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,346
you have never been
more beautiful

420
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,599
and talented

421
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:28,820
and perfect than you are
at this very moment.

422
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,856
Your time is now.

423
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,742
And you're gonna kill it.

424
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:35,777
Thank you, Louis.

425
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,780
No.

426
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:41,916
Thank you.

427
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:44,786
My middle name is Roberta.

428
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:49,757
I'm so sorry for that.

429
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,464
- Hey.
- Hey.

430
00:16:58,467 --> 00:16:59,667
Were you working late?

431
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,220
You really have to ask?

432
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,858
Thought maybe it would be nice
for us to lie down a little bit.

433
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:10,728
Together.

434
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,063
I would love that,

435
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,483
but if I lie down,
I probably won't get back up.

436
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,124
I know you don't want
to hear this,

437
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,460
but I was thinking about it,

438
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:29,197
and Harvey did kind of
give me special treatment.

439
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,217
- Mike.
- He let me skip law school.

440
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,338
Yeah.

441
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:38,640
Hey.

442
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:41,709
Maybe if you just find
the right time to ask, you know.

443
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,763
I did,
and he bit my head off.

444
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,018
So please just let it go.

445
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,520
Okay?
Okay.

446
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:55,273
Just wish all this Harvey
and Logan bullshit

447
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,609
would be over.

448
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,162
Yeah, me too.

449
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:02,230
Maybe when it is,

450
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,399
we can get out of town
for a weekend.

451
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,919
I would love that.

452
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:25,475
I'm worried Cahill, Harvey.

453
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:27,386
I've checked
with everyone I know.

454
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,553
He hasn't done a thing.

455
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:30,472
Me too, which is exactly
why I'm worried.

456
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:31,890
Jessica, I don't know
what to say.

457
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:34,109
If I have to look over
my shoulder every 15 seconds,

458
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:35,593
I might as well
give up right now.

459
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,779
Okay, but it doesn't mean
you stop looking altogether.

460
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:40,198
[Knocking]
Hey, do you have a minute?

461
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:41,366
Did you set up that trust?

462
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:43,568
- No.
- In that case, we don't.

463
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:44,736
I did something better.

464
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,071
We're listening.

465
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:48,273
One of the biggest red flags
at the S.E.C.

466
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,043
is a stock purchase with money
kept in trust for clients.

467
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:52,077
We've gone over this.

468
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:54,112
Let him finish.

469
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,714
On the other hand,

470
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:58,283
there's nothing unusual
about a retainer.

471
00:18:58,301 --> 00:18:59,918
A retainer?

472
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:01,086
From what I gather,

473
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,221
this takeover is
a massive undertaking, right?

474
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:04,973
Now, I don't know how you've
structured Logan's payments,

475
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:07,959
but I think it's time he pay
this firm a hefty fee up front

476
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:10,795
and something on the order
of $20 million.

477
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:13,932
And we use $20 million of
our own money to buy that stock.

478
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:15,350
There's nothing
that prohibits us

479
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:17,235
from investing as a firm.

480
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,937
And when the bulk
of our legal work is done,

481
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:20,405
turns out
he has money coming back.

482
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,574
We may just end up
giving him the shares

483
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:24,242
instead of his unused retainer.

484
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:25,477
Which we cannot plan

485
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:27,312
or even discuss
with Logan Sanders in advance.

486
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,780
And that makes it legal?

487
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,533
No.

488
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,702
It makes it questionable,

489
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:35,537
because they still might
figure out what we did

490
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:36,588
and make a case.

491
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:37,839
We?

492
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:40,258
You tell me, Harvey.

493
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,294
Am I on the team now?

494
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:43,512
Sounds like you're being

495
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,464
a little bit of a dickhead
about this whole thing,

496
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:49,601
so I'd say yes.

497
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:01,897
Louis?

498
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:02,981
Do you have a minute?

499
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:04,316
Oh, no.

500
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,683
It could not have been that bad.

501
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:07,035
Oh, it wasn't.

502
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,455
It was amazing.

503
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,324
I mean,
it was like riding a bike.

504
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,408
I got two standing Os,

505
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,993
and I got you
to thank for it.

506
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:17,212
Well, that's great.

507
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:18,363
What's wrong?

508
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:19,714
Shylock got drunk
at the after-party,

509
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:21,917
fell down a flight of stairs,
and broke his ankle,

510
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:24,503
which means the show
won't go on.

511
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:27,038
No, no, no,
the show must go on.

512
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:30,942
Well, the show can go on.

513
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,514
- No.
- Louis.

514
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:38,049
Come on, you're the only one
who can do it.

515
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:41,570
No, I can't.

516
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:44,105
I wanted to be a molar.

517
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:46,408
But that teacher's pet,
Dorothy McHale, got the part,

518
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:49,244
so I was forced to be plaque.

519
00:20:49,278 --> 00:20:51,913
Had to wear this ridiculous
flesh-colored unitard

520
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:53,748
and drape myself
over my classmates,

521
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:56,585
and every parent in the audience
laughed at me.

522
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:57,836
Louis.

523
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,004
And then the next year,
I got a bigger part.

524
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,957
Walked right out onstage.

525
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:05,460
Tommy Gallup screams out,
"plaque man!"

526
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:08,463
Once again,
everyone laughs at me.

527
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:13,101
So right then and there,
middle of the stage, I--

528
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:21,560
I peed my pants.

529
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:23,144
So I ran right off the stage,

530
00:21:23,196 --> 00:21:24,563
never went back,

531
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:27,199
and I am not going back again.

532
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:30,068
Louis.

533
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:33,572
A part like this doesn't
come around very often.

534
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:36,074
You gave me a gift,
and I killed it because of you.

535
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,275
Donna, please.

536
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:40,045
I'm not a lawyer, Louis.

537
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:43,548
This is my chance to shine.

538
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:48,503
But I'm about to lose
two more glorious nights.

539
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:53,008
I've never asked anyone
for anything like this,

540
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,810
but there's no other choice.

541
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:58,430
Please do this for me.

542
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:04,319
Please.

543
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:07,805
You want me to sell
directly to you?

544
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:08,823
I don't want you to.

545
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:10,025
You're going to.

546
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:11,493
Why would I do that?

547
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:12,694
Because I'm the only one

548
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,306
who's gonna buy your block
at a premium,

549
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:15,997
instead of you flooding
the market with shares

550
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:16,998
and ending up
getting a discount.

551
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,917
That's funny.

552
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:21,169
That's exactly what someone else
just told me an hour ago.

553
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:22,254
What?

554
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,705
And now I'll tell you
what I told him.

555
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,123
I'll shut everyone else out,

556
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:28,993
but you two are gonna
have to go head-to-head.

557
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:31,212
You're talking
about a dark pool bidding war.

558
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:32,347
That's no different

559
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:33,682
than what you were
talking about.

560
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:35,634
You just wanted to be
the only one bidding.

561
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:37,769
Thanks for the scampi,
Mr. Ross.

562
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:39,471
It was delicious.

563
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,673
I'll be in touch
with the details.

564
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:44,693
Who's the other entity?

565
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:46,978
If you can't figure that out
for yourself,

566
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:48,093
I don't think you're likely

567
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:51,399
to come out on top
of this whole thing.

568
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:07,832
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

569
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:09,134
I think
I'm washing my hands,

570
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:11,336
which I'd like to do
without you bothering me

571
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,054
about whatever bullshit
you're here for.

572
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:14,339
Bullshit?

573
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,093
We'll see if the S.E.C.
thinks it's bullshit

574
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:17,642
that you're
buying stock illegally.

575
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,844
You're throwing some
pretty big accusations around

576
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:20,895
for such a little guy.

577
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,314
You think I didn't do
my homework?

578
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:23,881
The registered bidder
traces back

579
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:24,899
to a shell corporation

580
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,935
we used six times last year.

581
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:28,403
We're allowed to play
the stock market

582
00:23:28,437 --> 00:23:29,604
as much as the next fellow.

583
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:31,356
You think
because you're using firm money,

584
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,390
that makes it legal?

585
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:33,775
Damn right I do,

586
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:35,243
because we have no plan
to do anything

587
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:37,245
other than keep those shares
ourselves.

588
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,413
Now who's talking bullshit?

589
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:40,031
What are you gonna do, Mike?

590
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:41,533
You gonna run to the S.E.C.?

591
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,702
You think I won't?

592
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:45,370
These aren't your daddy's tapes,
Harvey.

593
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:46,671
These are
the rules of the game.

594
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:48,790
Then let me dial their number
for you,

595
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:50,258
because if you report us,

596
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:51,926
they'll put a freeze
on this sale,

597
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:54,012
and by the time we get it
all straightened out,

598
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,680
my T.R.O. will be expired,

599
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:56,765
and we'll be right back

600
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,218
to where we're headed
this afternoon.

601
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:04,105
You're a sore goddamn loser.

602
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,025
I would be if I ever lost.

603
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,728
See you at 6:00.

604
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,565
Guess what
piece of shit lawyer

605
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,533
just got himself a seat
in the Wexler pool.

606
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:16,768
Mike, what are you doing here?

607
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:17,769
What do you mean?

608
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,953
The sale's not until 6:00.

609
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:20,288
Didn't you check
your messages?

610
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:21,322
No. Why?

611
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:23,992
Columbia University called.

612
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:27,295
Rachel was taken
to the hospital.

613
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:40,753
- Rachel Zane.
- Sorry?

614
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,770
You have a patient here,
Rachel Zane.

615
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:42,805
What room is she in?

616
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,723
Miss Zane is resting and can--

617
00:24:44,757 --> 00:24:46,024
What room is she in?

618
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,927
As I was saying,
she can't have any visitors.

619
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,978
Look at me.

620
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:52,281
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Mike.

621
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:53,699
She's in 1024.

622
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:54,766
You've seen her?

623
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,402
- It's locked.
- I don't care.

624
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:58,737
What are you gonna do?
You gonna break the door down?

625
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,440
- Yeah, if I have to.
- I spoke to her doctors.

626
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,625
They said she fainted at school.
She's fine.

627
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,110
If she fainted,
she's not fine.

628
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,779
They said she's run down
and a little dehydrated

629
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,114
but that she's okay.

630
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,416
Okay, so then--then why won't
they let us see her?

631
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,801
Because she's sleeping,
and she needs it.

632
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,553
Mike, she's fine.

633
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:15,587
She's gonna be fine.

634
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:16,748
What are you even doing here?

635
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:18,006
I'm one
of her emergency contacts.

636
00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:19,141
They called me.

637
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:20,426
Yeah, I know, but--

638
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,626
What's a heartless shithead
like me

639
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,645
doing in a place like this?

640
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,963
Yeah, something like that.

641
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,398
I would have come for you

642
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:29,902
if you ever worked hard enough
to pass out, but you never did.

643
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,404
[Scoffs]

644
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:36,024
Look, there's a steakhouse
across the street.

645
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:38,527
Why don't you and I
go get something to eat?

646
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,312
What, you gonna break
the door down and wake her up?

647
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,830
No, I'm gonna wait
outside of it

648
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:42,948
and be there when she does.

649
00:25:42,982 --> 00:25:43,982
Yeah, which won't happen

650
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:45,200
for another eight hours,

651
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:47,619
because they sedated her
to make sure she got some sleep.

652
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:50,005
Come on,
let's go get some food.

653
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,928
Don't you need to be
at an auction?

654
00:25:55,962 --> 00:25:57,796
Right now, I don't want
to be at that sale

655
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,097
any more than you do.

656
00:25:59,132 --> 00:26:00,933
You're saying you're willing
to postpone it?

657
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:03,685
I'm saying I already did.
Come on.

658
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:10,609
No, I'm telling you,
Dr. Lipschitz,

659
00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:12,978
this is like the whole
plaque incident all over again.

660
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:17,015
Yes, I have told you
about the plaque incident,

661
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,200
at least twice.

662
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:20,519
I've--no, that--
you know, it doesn't--

663
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,703
you know what, forget it.
That's not the point.

664
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:23,205
The point is,
is that I'm supposed to be

665
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:24,623
leaving for the theater
in ten minutes,

666
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:26,208
and I am a complete wreck.

667
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:27,292
I have the worst case
of cottonmouth

668
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:30,329
in the history of--

669
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:32,381
what? No, you can talk
with cotton mouth.

670
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:34,383
That's frickin' lockjaw.

671
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:35,534
You know something, Doc?

672
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,969
Sometimes I just think
that I've wasted

673
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:38,220
every single Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday

674
00:26:38,254 --> 00:26:40,839
for the last 14 years.

675
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:46,311
You know,
this is the first time

676
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:48,013
we've ever had a steak dinner.

677
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:49,681
I didn't know
you were keeping a tally.

678
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:52,935
It's pretty easy to do
when the grand total is zero.

679
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,720
I know.

680
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:56,978
I said I wanted to take you out

681
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,510
the night you told me
you were leaving.

682
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:02,110
We never got around to it.

683
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:05,030
I never got around to it.

684
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,002
What's the real reason you
were at the hospital tonight?

685
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:13,038
The truth?

686
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:14,739
Rachel asked me
for some time off,

687
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:16,508
and I all but spit in her face.

688
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:18,377
So you felt guilty?

689
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:19,962
Pretty much.

690
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,746
Plus,
I knew you needed something

691
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,181
to take your mind off her,

692
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:27,603
but I can see this dinner
with me isn't working, so...

693
00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:29,605
Here.

694
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,523
Holy shit.

695
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:33,141
What is this?

696
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:34,977
Louis is in a play.

697
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,278
You wanted to cheer me up,

698
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:37,913
and you didn't
start the night with this?

699
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,031
Come on.

700
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:40,616
I wanted to save something
for dessert.

701
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,766
Oh, my God, that's got to be
a codpiece, right?

702
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:43,285
What are you asking me for?

703
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,639
I don't want to know if Louis
is packing that kind of heat.

704
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:47,239
You think I do?

705
00:27:47,273 --> 00:27:48,373
You're the one
who went mudding with him.

706
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:49,658
It was covered in mud.

707
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,327
- How much mud?
- Stop.

708
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:54,796
Why would I ask that?

709
00:27:54,831 --> 00:27:57,416
Oh, man.

710
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,505
I shouldn't be laughing at him.

711
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:07,843
He still hasn't forgiven me
for using Sheila against him.

712
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:12,064
Mike, you did
what you had to do.

713
00:28:12,098 --> 00:28:13,599
You don't think
that was crossing a line?

714
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:14,983
It was way over the line.

715
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:17,069
But I got to tell you,
it was brilliant.

716
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:20,238
It was harsh,
but it was brilliant.

717
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,978
You know, Harvey,
I-I never told you.

718
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,748
What you did with Gillis...

719
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:34,920
I know you had to do it.

720
00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:38,423
Like I said before,
we do what we need to do.

721
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:45,514
Louis, you're almost up.

722
00:28:45,548 --> 00:28:47,516
Oh, Christ, you're sweating
more than Nixon.

723
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,934
I've gone through
four Elizabethan collars

724
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:50,185
and a codpiece.

725
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:51,186
Okay, just breathe.
You're gonna be fine.

726
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,304
No, I can't do it.

727
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,606
Louis, we are
in the middle of the play.

728
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:56,525
You'll have to ad-lib.
Make something up.

729
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,693
Say shylock went away.

730
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:59,344
Say that he went to Israel.
Oh, my God.

731
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,445
Wow!

732
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,516
I don't even know what--
you know what?

733
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,235
I never thought
you'd be so weak.

734
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:08,520
Okay, why do you got to say
something hurtful right now?

735
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,688
Oh, screw hurt!

736
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,190
Turn that into rage.
Why would I do-

737
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,127
You always turn hurt into
rage, you idiotic piece of shit.

738
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:16,411
It is what you do.

739
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:17,462
Okay, now I'm mad at you.

740
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:18,697
Good!

741
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,332
Now, imagine you're in court.
Court, how?

742
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:21,533
It's too hard with the curtain.
Just do it, dipshit.

743
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,751
Okay, fine,
I'm in court, God damn it.

744
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,137
You happy now?
No, I'm not happy, you idiot.

745
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:27,305
Now, you're in court,

746
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,375
and you're enraged,
and you are fit to kill.

747
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,178
Now, do you see
that audience out there?

748
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:35,213
That's your jury.
They're a bunch of morons.

749
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,431
Yeah, they're beneath you,
aren't they?

750
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:37,566
- They're beneath everybody.
- What else?

751
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,880
They're a bunch
of civil servants

752
00:29:38,884 --> 00:29:40,385
who can't keep up
with what I'm saying.

753
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,903
You have absolute and total
contempt for them, don't you?

754
00:29:41,938 --> 00:29:44,489
I want to rip out their stupid
brains from their stupid heads.

755
00:29:44,524 --> 00:29:45,890
Exactly.

756
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:48,727
Now, get out there
and make your case.

757
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,985
Unless of course you're a pussy

758
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,730
and you were meant to play
plaque your whole life.

759
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,332
3,000 ducats.

760
00:29:58,237 --> 00:30:00,071
I'm gonna head back.

761
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,875
Hey, tell Rachel she should
take the day off tomorrow.

762
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,379
Thanks for this, Harvey.

763
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:09,080
Excuse me.

764
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,132
Which one of you is Franklin,

765
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,551
and which one of you is Bash?

766
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:14,586
Did you boys have a nice date?

767
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,638
Couldn't be better.
He even paid.

768
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,306
Oh, I guess
he's flush with cash

769
00:30:18,357 --> 00:30:19,357
ever since he left you

770
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,759
in order to do
investment banking.

771
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,777
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

772
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,762
No, but I know you.
Mike Ross.

773
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,096
Sean here is with the S.E.C.,

774
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,115
and he's using his position
to harass my clients

775
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,200
on behalf of Eric Woodall.

776
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:29,451
Actually, not anymore, Harvey.

777
00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:33,822
I decided to take your advice
and focus on you.

778
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,207
Are you following me?

779
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:36,374
Oh, I've got guys who do that.

780
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:37,826
Then you also better have
authorization

781
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,411
from the Justice Department.

782
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:40,879
Getting authorization
was easy,

783
00:30:40,913 --> 00:30:42,047
because I told them you two

784
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:44,216
are on opposite sides
of a takeover battle

785
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,835
and that your girlfriend
is your associate.

786
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,253
Are you trying to say
that we're colluding?

787
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:49,287
Oh, you went right there,
didn't you?

788
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,505
Because you led him there.

789
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:51,890
Well, in the six hours
that I've been there,

790
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:53,258
this is what I've learned.

791
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:56,011
Your girlfriend, who I just
mentioned works for you,

792
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,396
faints at law school
for five minutes.

793
00:30:58,431 --> 00:30:59,848
You guys meet at the hospital.

794
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,220
Then you have dinner
for two hours

795
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,235
where you cancel
a private stock sale

796
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:05,987
that you both arranged,
and one hour ago,

797
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:07,856
that stock mysteriously
gets bought

798
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,308
by some shell corporation
set up last year.

799
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,326
- Wait, what?
- Bullshit.

800
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,444
Here's my favorite part,

801
00:31:12,478 --> 00:31:13,995
where you feign outrage
and you feign ignorance

802
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,031
to help sell the whole story.

803
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:22,954
Anyway, I just wanted
to give you a little heads-up.

804
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:27,509
Smile for the cameras.
Harvey.

805
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,682
- You gave me your word.
- And I kept it.

806
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:35,217
Oh, yeah,
then what about this stock?

807
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,635
- Jessica must have done it.
- Bullshit.

808
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:37,886
No, it's not bullshit.

809
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:38,937
Yeah, and when were you
planning on telling me

810
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,355
this guy was up your ass
for collusion?

811
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:42,641
I didn't know about this
until five seconds ago.

812
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:44,726
There are only so many things
I can buy, Harvey.

813
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,279
Listen to me, we can deal
with this guy's bullshit later.

814
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:49,948
Right now, let me deal
with the stock situation.

815
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:51,702
I'll make it right.
You can't make it right.

816
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:54,236
Mike, you used to trust me.

817
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,455
I need you to trust me
right now.

818
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,250
[Whispers]
Rachel, wake up.

819
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:20,003
Hey.
Where were you so late?

820
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:25,258
I was out, thinking.

821
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:26,459
Thinking what?

822
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,795
I don't want to be a fraud.

823
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,764
What?

824
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:32,766
I love you.

825
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,235
I'm married to her,

826
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:37,070
but I don't want
to do that anymore.

827
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:38,738
I want to be married to you.

828
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:40,573
Logan.

829
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:43,410
Rachel...

830
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:45,578
Will you marry me?

831
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,146
I can't.

832
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:49,833
Why not?

833
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,335
Because you'll always be
a fraud.

834
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,621
How can you say that to me?

835
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:56,989
[Gasps]

836
00:32:57,007 --> 00:32:58,508
Hey.

837
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,009
You okay?

838
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,044
Hey.

839
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:05,465
Come on,
go back to sleep.

840
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:08,134
I'll be here when you wake up.

841
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:17,360
Who told you
to buy that stock?

842
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,945
Excuse me?

843
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:20,313
Let me start again.

844
00:33:20,347 --> 00:33:21,448
Hello, Jessica.

845
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:23,733
I just found out
we bought the Wexler block.

846
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,618
Would you by any chance know
how that came to happen?

847
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:27,487
It came to happen
when I found out

848
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:30,123
the dark pool had been canceled
and I couldn't reach you.

849
00:33:30,157 --> 00:33:32,859
So you took it upon yourself
to make a preemptive bid.

850
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:33,910
Of course I did.

851
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:35,912
If I hadn't,
Forstman would have.

852
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,714
So why are you here?

853
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:41,033
I gave Mike my word
we'd postpone the sale.

854
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:42,869
Well, I didn't give
Mike anything.

855
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,220
Do you even want to know why?

856
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,371
Not particularly.

857
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:47,173
It was because Rachel
passed out at school

858
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:48,508
and was in the hospital.

859
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:49,809
Is she all right?

860
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:50,844
Do you care?

861
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:51,845
Don't you make me out

862
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:53,167
to be the villain in this,
Harvey.

863
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,483
I am sorry Rachel fainted,

864
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:58,067
but our obligation
is to our client,

865
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,770
and I'm not undoing that sale.

866
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:01,988
We can't tonight anyway.

867
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:03,389
Why not?

868
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:05,057
Because Cahill
came out of nowhere.

869
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,443
He's been
having me followed.

870
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:08,912
He thinks Mike and I
are colluding on Gillis,

871
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,114
and if we undo that sale,
it'll just fuel the fire.

872
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:13,199
I told you
I was still worried about him.

873
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:14,417
What did you want me to do?

874
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,753
Have myself tailed
to pick up a possible tail?

875
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:20,239
What did you come in here
to tell me, Harvey?

876
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:22,208
Now that Sean Cahill
is involved,

877
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:24,844
we also can't ever transfer
those shares to Logan.

878
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,764
Which conveniently helps
fix your deal with Mike Ross.

879
00:34:27,798 --> 00:34:29,048
- Jessica--
- You know what?

880
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:30,517
Doesn't matter.
We don't need to transfer them.

881
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:32,802
We'll just vote Logan's way
when the time comes.

882
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:36,422
Jessica,
I gave Mike my word.

883
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,975
Harvey, I don't care
if you took a blood oath.

884
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:43,279
Our duty is to our client,
not a handshake with Mike Ross.

885
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,398
And this discussion is over.

886
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,574
Checked you out.

887
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:56,876
You're free to go
on your own recognizance.

888
00:34:56,911 --> 00:34:58,127
How much was bail?

889
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,247
Oh, it's okay,
I took care of it.

890
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:02,799
How are you feeling?

891
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,217
You know,
I'm actually feeling--

892
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:05,251
I'm feeling pretty good.

893
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:06,532
In fact,
I think that I'm going--

894
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:09,055
Rachel, no,
you can't do any work today.

895
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:10,924
I'm just gonna
stop by the office

896
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:14,060
and put away just three files,
send four emails.

897
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:15,311
That's it.

898
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:20,099
I have to do this
just for my own peace of mind.

899
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:26,239
- No more.
- No more.

900
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:29,325
I won't even tell anybody
that I'm there.

901
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,311
I won't.

00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:33,809
Louis, can I talk to you
for a minute?

903
00:35:33,814 --> 00:35:34,914
Of course.

904
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:38,001
First of all,
you were remarkable last night.

905
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,487
- Who said?
- Everyone in the cast.

906

The <i>Flushing Chronicle?</i>

907
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:44,824
Um, you know, I don't
actually read the local--

908
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,627
You should, because they said
I was a shock to the senses.

909
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:48,795
I bought six copies
this morning.

910
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:50,046
I'm gonna send five to Esther,

911
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:52,015
because she thinks
she's such a great singer.

912
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,049
Okay.

913
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,500
Louis, what I came in here
to say--

914
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:55,685
Donna, I'm retiring.

915
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:59,138
You're what?

916
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:01,474
You helped me
get over a fear

917
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:03,643
that I never thought
I'd get over.

918
00:36:03,677 --> 00:36:06,195
But I don't want to see
the audience as the jury.

919
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,382
I don't want to have disdain
for them.

920
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:13,353
I am the audience,

921
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:16,422
and I want to love them.

922
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:19,158
- Louis.
- Donna, I'm sorry.

923
00:36:19,192 --> 00:36:20,627
Because I know I'm taking away

924
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:22,028
your last glorious night
from you,

925
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:25,415
but I can't go on again.

926
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:27,467

927
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:30,837
I can't do it.

928
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:32,305
It's okay, Louis.

929
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:33,423
It's okay.

930
00:36:33,474 --> 00:36:36,042
It turns out
that the other shylock

931
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,211
only sprained his ankle.

932
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:43,716
Looks like he's gonna be able
to go on tonight after all.

933
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,385
Wait a minute.

934
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:48,938
He never hurt his ankle at all,
did he?

935
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,181
You know,
I just knew that you had

936
00:36:54,194 --> 00:36:58,665
a lot of things going on lately
with Harvey and Malone,

937
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:01,451
and sometimes the best way
to deal with disappointment

938
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:04,871
in one arena
is to accomplish something else.

939
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,740
Thank you.

You're welcome, Louis.

that you're not a lawyer?

You could be.

- God damn it, I knew it.

947

I knew you wouldn't fix it.

948
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,871
- I tried.
- You tried?

949
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:30,173
You're a name partner.

950
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,375
And she's the managing
partner, and you know it.

951
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:33,376
That wouldn't have
made a difference

952

if you were fighting for you.

I fought Jessica for you
and won more than once,

but this isn't
one of those times, Mike.

Believe me,
this isn't what I wanted.

No.

Nothing?

What do you mean nothing?

972
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,128

You think I didn't know
what you were up to?

978
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:21,267
You tried
not to fund the money,

979
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,045

out of the deal

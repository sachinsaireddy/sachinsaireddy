00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:01,211
Previously on Suits...

2
00:00:01,263 --> 00:00:03,455
Walter, I can't guarantee you
we'll win,

3
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:06,841
but I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

4
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:08,828
Well, you told me that
Mike Ross wasn't a threat,

5
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:10,364
and then he handcuffed us
with a T.R.O.

6
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,463
I want proof that
he's giving up his bid,

7
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:13,881
and if I don't get it
by the morning,

8
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:15,549
I'm gonna call
my private investigators,

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,550
and I'm gonna finish
what I started.

10
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,185
What did Harvey tell you?

11
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:19,653
Looks like
he told me the truth.

12
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,021
We're done.

13
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,274
I want you to stop
the personal attacks on Mike.

14
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:25,038
You told me this
wasn't gonna be a problem.

15
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,479
You don't have to stop this
because you're some changed man.

16
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:30,564
You have to stop this
because you owe me.

17
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:31,632
Mr. Ross.

18
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:32,566
Eric Woodall.

19
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:34,034
I'm the U.S. attorney for--

20
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:35,453
The southern district
of New York.

21
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:36,620
I know who you are.

22
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,289
Since when does the S.E.C.
go around

23
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,875
intimidating law firms
by going after their clients?

24
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:42,076
They don't,
but they will

25
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:43,728
when Eric Woodall starts there
next week.

26
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:44,745
It started.

27
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,548
Seven clients, seven subpoenas,

28
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,133
all coming tomorrow.

29
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:09,653
Uh, excuse me,
you don't have an appointment.

30
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:10,804
I don't need an appointment.

31
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,573
Sit down, shut up,
and listen.

32
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:15,459
Harvey might forgive you because
you returned those recordings,

33
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:16,427
but I don't.

34
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,761
- Donna.
- Not done.

35
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:19,980
What Harvey did with Gillis,
it was harsh,

36
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:22,900
but using what I told you
in a private conversation--

37
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:25,052
that crosses a line
that even Harvey never would.

38
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,787
- Donna.
- Still not done.

39
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:29,857
When you left our firm,
you left me too,

40
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,359
but I honestly thought
that we'd always be friends.

41
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,362
Now I'm not so sure.

42
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,264
Amy, did you send Donna
the package?

43
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:38,832
Guilt gift.
Didn't open it.

44
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:41,135
It was a balenciaga
classic town bag.

45
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,203
Ivory?

46
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,591
Anthracite
with an outside pocket.

47
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:44,655
His idea or yours?

48
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:45,956
Don't answer that.

49
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,343
It was yours.

50
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,578
I'm sorry, Donna.

51
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:52,279
You and Harvey want to
knock each other out,

52
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:54,281
you go right ahead.

53
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,450
But don't ever
betray me again.

54
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:00,037
Nice shoes.

55
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:05,459
She's even better
than I imagined.

56
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:20,824
Looking for this?

57
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,194
Harvey Specter.

58
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:25,696
What brings you to Montclair
at 7:00 in the morning?

59
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,614
Oh, you know
what brings me here.

60
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,417
I woke up to find these
on my welcome mat.

61
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:33,020
Well, as much as I'd love
to have been responsible

62
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:36,156
for subpoenaing seven
of your firm's top clients,

63
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,425
I didn't even know about this
till just now.

64
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,613
You didn't even have the balls
to come at me directly.

65
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,263
Get off my property.

66
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,514
What's the matter, Eric?

67
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,116
You're afraid
I'll get you fired again?

68
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,101
I get it.

69
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:50,871
You want to hear me say
I'm using my new position

70
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,739
to destroy your business,

71
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,259
'cause you're the piece
of garbage that got me fired.

72
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,810
Isn't that what you
want to hear me say?

73
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,313
Oh, I know
you'll never say that,

74
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:01,031
but I do want you to admit
that you sent

75
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:03,117
an agent Brian Harris
after my firm.

76
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:05,002
Sorry.
I don't even have jurisdiction

77
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,520
over that department.

78
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:09,173
That department's run by a man
name Sean Cahill.

79
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,457
So all on his own,

80
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:13,010
Sean Cahill just happened
to target my firm?

81
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,095
Well, he is a killer attorney

82
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:17,948
with a nose for sleazy lawyers,

83
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:19,266
and I should know.

84
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:21,201
We came up together
at the Justice Department.

85
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,404
You know, that little
governmental agency

86
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,822
that protects their own?

87
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,874
Well, Eric, your big brother
couldn't protect you

88
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,208
from getting fired before,

89
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:30,878
and I don't see how this is
gonna be any different,

90
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:34,048
and by the way,
that's yesterday's paper.

91
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,084
You wanted to see me?

92
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,135
Sure did.

93
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,287
Have a seat.

94
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:42,289
I was going over
our trade sheets.

95
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,974
Couldn't help but notice

96
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:46,260
you bought another 100,000
shares of Gillis Industries.

97
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,478
It's gonna be fine.

98
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,179
Do I look like an asshole
to you?

99
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:50,630
Where the hell
did you get the money?

100
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:53,100
You know where
I got the money.

101
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:54,485
I bought those shares on margin.

102
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,569
And leveraged my company.

103
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,654
The bylaws said I can do it.

104
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:58,238
I don't care
what the bylaws say,

105
00:03:58,306 --> 00:03:59,857
you did this without asking.

106
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:01,022
Look, I know you're pissed.

107
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:02,026
Oh, I'm not pissed.

108
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,577
I've been waiting for you

109
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,245
to have the balls
to do something like this

110
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:06,313
since you got here.

111
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:07,831
You raised my risk,

112
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,796
but you also raised my reward,
and on top of it,

113
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,419
you did it like
an investment banker,

114
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:14,121
without permission.

115
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,960
Well, thank you, Jon.

116
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,379
Go get 'em.

117
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,050
One more thing.
Yeah?

118
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:28,769
You have a week
to de-leverage my company.

119
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,938
If you don't,
you're out of a job.

120
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,176
You want to explain to me why

121
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:38,028
you went to Eric Woodall's house
this morning?

122
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:39,530
I understand
you're bent out of shape

123
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:41,065
because I stepped on
your territory--

124
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,950
You think I give a shit
about my territory?

125
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,417
What the hell are you doing
in here?

126
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:45,567
Listen, I really don't care

127
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,071
if you work this thing
or I do,

128
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:49,206
but whoever it is has to
not be an idiot.

129
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,991
And how, exactly,
am I an idiot?

130
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,494
- You poked the bear.
- Eric Woodall isn't the bear.

131
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:55,379
No. I am.

132
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:58,365
And whatever you were
about to say, don't say it.

133
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,667
Harvey, this is his case.

134
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,052
It's why we brought him in,

135
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:03,337
and I don't want you involved.

136
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:04,388
Me?

137
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:05,506
I'm the one who found out

138
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:06,706
it's not Woodall
coming after us, it's--

139
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:08,425
Sean Cahill.

140
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,810
You think I didn't know that?

141
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,262
These are my clients,
and when they call in a panic,

142
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:14,264
I need to be the voice
on the other end of the line.

143
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,550
Then be the voice
on the other end of the line,

144
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:18,318
but you're not
handling the S.E.C.

145
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,154
I'm the reason
they're coming after us.

146
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:22,322
Which is why you wanted to
hire Jeff in the first place.

147
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,108
That was before
all this became real.

148
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,359
Now that it's happening,

149
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,560
he doesn't want to
sit on the sidelines.

150
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:27,995
Damn right I don't.

151
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,197
Well, then find yourself
a comfortable spot on the bench,

152
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,533
because like it or not,
Jeff's in charge.

So it go just like
you said it would?

164
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:12,823
Exactly, except for the part

165
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,574
where if I don't find
a new investor in a week,

166
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:15,776
I'm out of a job.

167
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,444
I'm surprised
he gave you a week.

168
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,613
- Amy, it's not funny.
- I know it isn't.

169
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:22,232
I was just trying to make
the best of the situation.

170
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,234
Well, if you want to make
the best of the situation,

171
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:25,952
get me a meeting
with Tony Gianopolous,

172
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:29,372
because if I can't get
in there...

173
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:30,590
I'm in trouble.

174
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:32,759
We're in trouble.

175
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,544
You really mean that?

176
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:38,298
You think I'm staying here
if you leave?

177
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:39,599
Thank you, Amy.

178
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:40,851
I'm just kidding.

179
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:42,198
Epstein's been trying
to poach me

180
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,804
since the day I got here.
Mmm. Tch.

181
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:45,806
Yeah, you think those flowers
bought themselves?

182
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,607
Mm-mm.

183
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:50,811
You--wow.

184
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:58,635
Can I talk to you a second?

185
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:00,570
If you want an update
on the takeover,

186
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:02,272
you should talk to Harvey.

187
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,591
That's not why I'm here.

188
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,226
Look, Logan,
I-I know that you--

189
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,829
I have five companies here

190
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:10,380
that I'm looking at
for my next deal,

191
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,482
and I need someone
to evaluate them

192
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,352
from a legal standpoint.

193
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,888
- Your next deal.
- Yeah, my next deal.

194
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:20,356
Harvey told me
not to hurt my future

195
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,758
by going below the belt
with Mike,

196
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,225
so instead of not
hurting my future,

197
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:25,028
I thought I'd start
planning for it.

198
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,864
So then maybe Harvey is who
you should be planning it with.

199
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:29,566
Well, Harvey's
got stuff to do,

200
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:31,795
and he's not the one who
convinced me to back off Mike.

201
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:33,887
Are you saying that I owe you?

202
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:35,038
No, I'm not saying that,

203
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,473
but that is what you said to me.

204
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,742
So we're just gonna go
back and forth, trading favors?

205
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,076
Rachel, this isn't a favor.

206
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:41,795
I have a board meeting
on Friday.

207
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,163
I need to be prepared.

208
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:45,549
So are you my lawyer or not?

209
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:48,735
I will get right on it.

210
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,737
Thank you.

211
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,660
Louis, I need your help.
We're gonna need to--

212
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,894
Don't speak.

213
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,899
You may speak.

214
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,000
What were you doing?

215
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:07,037
Just thanking
the lord God almighty.

216
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:08,838
We taking down Jessica?
We firing Malone?

217
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:09,906
I am tingling.

218
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:11,241
What, Harvey?
Just tell me what.

219
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:14,211
Mike Ross just bought another
2% of Gillis Industries.

220
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:16,213
He must be leveraged up
to his scrawny little neck.

221
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:18,381
Exactly, and he's gonna be
scrambling for funding.

222
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,400
[Snaps] You want me
to get your T.R.O. removed.

223
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:21,484
How do you know that?

224
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:23,453
Because you pissed off
judge Ramos

225
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,821
and now she
can't stand you.

226
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,006
How do you know that?

227
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,257
Oh, because I keep
a list of your enemies.

228
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,558
You want to see it?
Just get it done.

229
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:29,693
Oh, I'm gonna get it done.

230
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,361
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

231
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,896
Louis, we're splitting
Mike's focus.

232
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:34,764
That doesn't mean
he won't be prepared.

233
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:36,072
Oh, he can prepare
all he wants,

234
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,368
but the student is about to meet
the master,

235
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,387
because Ralph Macchio
doesn't stand a chance

236
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:42,005
against Mr. Miyagi.

237
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:44,908
You know <i>The Karate Kid?</i>

238
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,034
That's not cool, Harvey.

239
00:08:57,088 --> 00:09:00,290
Oh, let me see
if I can guess why you're here.

240
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:02,092
You came to tell me
the way I handled Harvey

241
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,644
this morning was sexy.

242
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:06,630
Oh, you mean when I told him
to leave you alone?

243
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:10,533
And the way that I allowed you
to do that was very sexy.

244
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:12,302
Uh-huh.

245
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:14,771
And this is...

246
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:16,473
The Griffen Cosmetics
subpoena.

247
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,557
I looked them all over.

248
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:18,775
This is the weakest one.

249
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,777
- The weakest one?
- Exactly.

250
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:23,830
Once this one goes down,
the others fall like dominos.

251
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:25,882
First of all, if I were gonna
take that strategy,

252
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,350
I would go for
the hardest one.

253
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:29,102
Second of all,
why don't you walk yourself

254
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:30,854
back to your office
and let me do my job?

255
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,089
Excuse me?

256
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:36,710
You told Harvey you
brought me in to handle this.

257
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:40,663
Your job isn't to worry about
what I told Harvey.

258
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:43,466
Your job is to worry about
what I'm telling you.

259
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,135
And what I'm telling you

260
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,604
is that I'm not walking
into an S.E.C. negotiation

261
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,571
with a babysitter.

262
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,106
Negotiation?

263
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,491
This is going to be a war.

264
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,710
I know that, and I'm gonna
win it with one shot.

265
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:55,211
Then I suggest you
warm up to this.

266
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,131
You're not walking into
the S.E.C. with a babysitter.

267
00:09:58,215 --> 00:10:01,084
You're walking in there
with a bazooka.

268
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,472
Hey, Mike,
you need to see something.

269
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,290
No, I don't have time.

270
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,958
I'm working on
the Gianopolous proposal.

271
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,227
Yeah, that proposal isn't
gonna matter if they win this.

272
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:19,519
Goddamn it.

273
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:21,271
Harvey's trying to roll back
the T.R.O.?

274
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:22,322
No, it's not Harvey.

275
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:23,323
Check the docket.

276
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:26,476
It's some woman named Lois Litt.

277
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:29,496
[Laughs]

278
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,581
Yeah.

279
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:32,648
I know how to handle her.

280
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,117
Um, here.

281
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,651
This is 90% done.
Check it over.

282
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,653
Make sure there's not
one comma out of place.

283
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,822
Mike, come on,
you know I can do more than--

284
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,458
- I don't have time, Amy.
Just do it.

285
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,009
Okay.

286
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,264
How long did you work
in this shit hole?

287
00:10:48,332 --> 00:10:50,934
Sorry I'm late.
Been up to my neck in work.

288
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:53,019
Just filed seven huge subpoenas.

289
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:54,437
- Yeah, we know what you filed.
- Oh.

290
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:55,938
I see you brought the missus.

291
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,743
Jessica, whatever you're
about to say, don't say it.

292
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:01,778
How about I say it with this?

293
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:03,079
Ooh, a subpoena?

294
00:11:03,147 --> 00:11:04,147
[Sniffs]

295
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:05,381
Smells fresh.
It is.

296
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:07,193
And you'll be answering it
in court tomorrow.

297
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,518
Oh, well then I better see

298
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,538
what flavor bullshit
you're serving up.

299
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,523
[Muttering indistinctly]

300
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:15,158
Ah, ah, now,
this is a good one.

301
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:19,562
"Malicious prosecution
of Pearson Specter clients,"

302
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,951
and how exactly
are we doing that?

303
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:21,981
I'll tell you how.

304
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,299
You come at our clients.

305
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:24,651
Our clients leave us.

306
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:25,952
You drop their cases.

307
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:27,487
Well, I certainly
wouldn't tell them

308
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:29,205
that's how to avoid
S.E.C. scrutiny,

309
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,542
but it's not my fault
if dropping Pearson Specter

310
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,570
starts catching on.

311
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:34,594
Enough bullshit.

312
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,262
You're targeting my clients

313
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,414
on behalf of Eric Woodall,
and you know it.

314
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:40,300
That is a lovely theory,
but if you had any proof,

315
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:41,945
you wouldn't be standing here
right now.

316
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,820
I have proof, Sean.

317
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,054
I have proof you filed

318
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:46,689
seven cases in one day
against our clients,

319
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,181
which we both know
has never happened

320
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:49,692
in the history of the S.E.C.

321
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:51,111
It has now.

322
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:53,997
We've filed nine cases
against clients of Weil Gotshal,

323
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,165
eight against Skaaden,

324
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,751
and six against Cravath.

325
00:11:57,835 --> 00:11:59,586
Welcome to the new S.E.C.

326
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,287
We target law firms.

327
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,289
And as long as we're not
only targeting yours,

328
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,042
the only way to shut this down
is to shut us down.

329
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,127
You and I both know

330
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:09,745
what's really
going on here, Sean,

331
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:10,913
and I'm gonna prove it.

332
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,849
Well, good luck,
but how do you think

333
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,218
judge Hopkins is gonna respond
to your allegations

334
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,770
when I tell him
they're coming from a man

335
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:20,723
who is about to be fired?

336
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:22,759
Oh, you--
you didn't tell her.

337
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:26,229
Ooh, that's awkward.

338
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,647
I'll see you in court.

339
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,118
- Jessica!
- I don't want to hear it.

340
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:33,903
- Well, you need to hear it.
- What?

341
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,321
That you lied to me?

342
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:36,939
You know, I didn't
actually lie to you.

343
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,941
Oh, no, no, no.
You tell me that you didn't lie

344
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:40,794
because we never directly
asked you the question,

345
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,078
and I will knock
your head off.

346
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,079
All right, fine.

347
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,330
I lied.

348
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,948
I lied
because it doesn't matter.

349
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,168
I want to fight for you,
and I'm the best man to do it.

350
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:49,969
Well, the new part
of the equation

351
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:51,888
is that you just made me
look like a fool.

352
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:53,316
- Jess.
- Don't pull that Jess shit

353
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,058
with me--I want to know what
it says in your file.

354
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,260
- I don't know what it says.
- How the hell do you not know?

355
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,461
'Cause whatever it is
is bullshit.

356
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,430
Because the reason
they were gonna fire me

357
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:01,898
is that I refused
to go after you.

358
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:04,517
Then why didn't you
tell me that

359
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:06,319
when you came at us
demanding a job?

360
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,271
Because good lawyers negotiate

361
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:11,574
from a position of strength,
not weakness.

362
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:14,160
Well, the position
you just put us in

363
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:15,945
is pretty goddamn weak.

364
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,145
Oh well if it isn't
the boy wonder.

365
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,046
- Louis, hey.
- Don't Louis me.

366
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:29,434
You left without even
the courtesy

367
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,816
of a "how's your father?"
What does that mean?

368
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:34,374
It means that I'm not here
to exchange pleasantries.

369
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:35,958
I'm here to get
that T.R.O. lifted.

370
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,126
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

371
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:38,927
I'm also sorry
to hear about Sheila.

372
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:41,146
Bullshit you're sorry
to hear about she--

373
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,297
what are you
talking about?

374
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,605
Come on,
you have to have heard.

375
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,117
Heard what?

376
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,969
She's engaged.

377
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,104
It's all over Harvard's
Facebook page.

378
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:56,522
Oh, my God,
how could she do this?

379
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,957
She said she could never be
attracted to a handsome man.

380
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,858
And that picture doesn't
even do him justice,

381
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:01,809
but this one, however...

382
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:03,478
- A thong?
- Yeah.

383
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:05,613
That...
What the-

384
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:08,299
Yeah, it's a whole, like,
beach thing, I guess.

385
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,668
Long weekend.

386
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,536
You're a son of a bitch, Mike.

387
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:13,748
You're not even sorry at all.

388
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:15,139
You're using this
to get into my head.

389
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:16,607
Louis, come on,
I can't believe you.

390
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:18,276
You think I would use
Sheila's engagement

391
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:19,504
just to get you
off your game?

392
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:20,578
Never gonna work.

393
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:21,846
That I would
stick it in your face

394
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:23,475
that she's all up
in this guy's business

395
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:24,732
in a way that you've
never seen before?

396
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:25,934
Water off a duck's back.

397
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:27,735
That right now
she's probably scrapbooking

398
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,220
the first day
of their relationship,

399
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:30,738
which apparently happened
just weeks

400
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:33,491
after you broke her heart?

401
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,909
You're the devil.

402
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:36,277
Next up on the docket,

403
00:14:36,362 --> 00:14:38,696
Sidwell Investment group
versus Sanders International.

404
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:39,998
Looks like that's us.

405
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:41,146
[Pat]
I'll see you in there.

406
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:45,536
Louis, I can't believe it.

407
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,755
I give you one
goddamn job to do,

408
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,207
and you--
what are you doing up there?

409
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:50,808
Harvey, please, I can explain.

410
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:55,079
Oh, explain why you stood in
front of the judge like a moron?

411
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,247
What possible explanation--

412
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:58,983
Sheila got engaged.

413
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:00,685
What?

414
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:01,736
When?

415
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:02,954
This morning.

416
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:05,289
Louis, I'm sorry.

417
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:08,092
I was so sure
that she would just come around

418
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,627
about having children,
you know?

419
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:12,063
That's why I've been
turning down

420
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:13,698
all those J-date requests.

421
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,049
We'll get Mike another way.

422
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:16,894
Oh, you're goddamn right
we're gonna get him.

423
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:18,102
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch

424
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,170
if it's the last thing I do.

425
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,072
What are you talking about?

426
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,275
He used the Sheila news
to get into my head, Harvey.

427
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:28,980
Used the news
or gave you the news?

428
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:30,649
Oh, please,
what difference does it make?

429
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:31,859
What difference does it make?

430
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,451
It makes all the difference.

431
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,086
Like on the one hand,
I feel for you,

432
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:37,154
and on the other, you're
the world's biggest idiot.

433
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:38,172
Look at my computer.

434
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:39,390
I've been staring at it
for three hours.

435
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:40,418
It's real.

436
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:41,926
I don't believe it.

437
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:43,611
Yeah, that adonis
on that yacht,

438
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:44,862
Sheila's fiance.

439
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:47,198
That adonis
is a photoshopped picture

440
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:49,967
of Lorenzo Lamas from 1998!

441
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,369
Who the hell
is Lorenzo Lamas?

442
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:52,770
Well, I can tell you
who he isn't.

443
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:54,806
He isn't Sheila's fiance!

444
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:01,646
Oh, thank God.

445
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:03,815
Are you even listening?

446
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:06,117
It was bad enough
that Nigel rattled you

447
00:16:06,185 --> 00:16:07,685
with your unread cat letters.

448
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:08,993
Now you're letting Mike
do this?

449
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:11,022
- Harvey, please.
- Shut the hell up!

450
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:12,557
Look, I tried to warn you,

451
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:15,359
and you stood there with your
stupid leg up in the air,

452
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:18,162
telling me that the student
was no match for the master

453
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,399
and all it took
was one doctored picture

454
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:23,734
for you to shit the bed!

455
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:27,288
- I didn't mean to--
- Shut the hell up!

456
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:28,506
God.

457
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:36,798
Well, fancy meeting you here.

458
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:39,583
Rachel, get out of here.

459
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:43,554
I was just coming to
make some copy--

460
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:44,956
Louis, what's wrong?

461
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:46,924
I don't want to talk about it;
Nothing is wrong.

462
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:48,676
Well, obviously
something's wrong.

463
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,294
You know what,
if you're so curious,

464
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:51,813
why don't you just go ask
the man of your dreams?

465
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:54,065
I'm sure the two of you will
have a big laugh about it later.

466
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:55,900
Okay, I don't know
what you're talking about,

467
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,101
but seeing you like this,

468
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:58,870
there's no way
that I would laugh at you.

469
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:00,071
What is it?

470
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,240
Mike convinced me
that Sheila was engaged

471
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:03,908
to throw me off my game.

472
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:05,943
I'm so sorry, Louis.

473
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:07,712
Yeah, well, he sure wasn't.

474
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,547
Stuck a knife in me,
twisted it

475
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:11,415
with the thought of her
and another man.

476
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:14,852
It felt like
a drill in my skull all day,

477
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,037
and then to top it all off,

478
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:21,092
it cost me the respect
of my best friend.

479
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:23,945
Maybe--

480
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:26,397
Oh, don't you even try
to defend him.

481
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:27,899
No, I wasn't going to.

482
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:29,567
I was going to say,

483
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:32,136
maybe this is what you needed

484
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:35,139
to decide to reconnect
with Sheila.

485
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:36,607
And what about Harvey?

486
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:38,709
How do I repair that?

487
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:42,130
I'm really sorry
for what happened, Louis.

488
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:43,214
I am.

489
00:17:56,728 --> 00:17:58,346
- Hey.
- Hey.

490
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,647
Did you eat?

491
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:01,632
Are you asking because
you're concerned about me

492
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:05,670
or because you want to know
if I left you any food?

493
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:08,589
Whoa.

494
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:10,107
Tough day?
I'm sorry.

495
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:12,143
I've just been working
16-hour days,

496
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,413
and I'm really--
stressed.

497
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,614
Yeah, I know the feeling.

498
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:17,982
Really?

499
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:22,153
'Cause I heard that you had
a pretty big win today.

500
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:23,221
You talked to Harvey.

501
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:25,256
I talked to Louis.

502
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:26,641
Mike, I know you want to win,

503
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:29,527
but do you have any idea
what your lie did to him?

504
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:30,594
It wasn't a lie.

505
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:32,029
It was a strategy.

506
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:35,233
It was both, and it ended up
with him near tears.

507
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,601
Come on, Rachel.

508
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:38,586
It just seems like all
that matters to you is winning

509
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,838
and that you don't care about
what it does to your friends.

510
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:42,723
You know what?

511
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:44,559
I'm sorry that I hurt Louis,

512
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:45,964
but he was going to
that courtroom

513
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:47,712
so they could put their
tender offer to a vote.

514
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:49,480
I know.

515
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,999
You also know because we've
had this discussion before

516
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:53,834
that if he got his way,

517
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,520
they would rip that company
to shreds.

518
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:59,173
So instead of coming down on me
for what I did to Louis,

519
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:01,342
why don't you start worrying
about all the lives

520
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,928
that Logan Sanders is
gonna destroy if that happens?

521
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:15,573
You know, it's funny.

522
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,658
You told me you didn't care
who was in charge.

523
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:19,944
You just wanted whoever it was
to not be an idiot.

524
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,879
Are you saying
that I was an idiot?

525
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:23,297
I'm saying we both were.

526
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:25,282
I shouldn't have gone
to Woodall,

527
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:28,219
and you shouldn't have
lied to us.

528
00:19:28,286 --> 00:19:30,304
You don't seem pissed.

529
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:33,123
I've had enough happen
already today.

530
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:35,459
Besides,
lying to me was wrong,

531
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:37,761
but lying to the woman
you're in a relationship with

532
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,530
is a whole other level.

533
00:19:39,597 --> 00:19:41,732
When do you think
she's gonna get past it?

534
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:43,868
From personal experience,
that could take a while.

535
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:45,286
That's not my problem.

536
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,704
That's yours.

537
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:48,439
Then what are you doing here,
Harvey?

538
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,276
I'm here to tell you
what you're gonna do about it.

539
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:54,245
No.

540
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:55,413
No way.

541
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:57,114
I'm not taking the stand.

542
00:19:57,165 --> 00:19:58,449
Then what are you doing here?

543
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Because Woodall telling you
to go after our clients

544
00:20:00,552 --> 00:20:02,336
is how you got this job
in the first place

545
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:03,838
and happens to make our case.

546
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:05,339
He didn't outright tell me
to do it,

547
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:06,424
and you know it.

548
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:07,458
You had to find out somehow.

549
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,093
I found out
from Brian Harris.

550
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:11,679
He told me he had
this funny feeling

551
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:13,130
that the day after
Woodall arrived,

552
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:15,016
that I was gonna
start issuing subpoenas

553
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,518
to Pearson Specter clients.

554
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:20,971
When I asked him why,
he said, "you know why."

555
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:22,463
Then you're gonna
get up on the stand

556
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:24,808
and tell them that.
I can't. I have no proof.

557
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,078
It was vague, and it's
a third party conversation.

558
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:29,196
Which makes it hearsay,
and I don't give a shit.

559
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:31,666
Well, I do, 'cause it opens
me up to slander at best

560
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,250
and perjury charges at worst.

561
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:34,835
Well, Jeff,
you used that story

562
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,170
to get your ass in here.

563
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:39,123
Now use it to get the job done.

564
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:47,347
Amy!

565
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:49,712
I thought I asked you

566
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:51,646
to leave the Gianopolous
proposal on my desk.

567
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:53,715
And I did,
20 minutes ago.

568
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,083
What?
Okay.

569
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:57,018
Did you proof it?
No.

570
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:58,420
I thought you'd have
a better chance

571
00:20:58,471 --> 00:20:59,991
if the document
was riddled with typos.

572
00:21:00,022 --> 00:21:01,423
- This is important.
- I know it is,

573
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,924
which is why I read it
backwards and forwards.

574
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,292
Okay, did you add the part

575
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,660
about the leveraged recap
like I asked?

576
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:08,496
I did, but your figures
on the non-voting stock

577
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,832
didn't add up,
so I proposed a staggered board

578
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,334
to make up for the imbalance.

579
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,768
Staggered board?

580
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,203
Yeah, don't act so surprised.

581
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:16,738
I'm sorry,
I just thought that you--

582
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:18,526
You just thought
that I didn't know anything

583
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:19,891
about what goes on here?

584
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:21,192
Listen up, T. Boone Pickens,

585
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,444
I actually know a lot
about this business.

586
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:24,546
Okay, I said I'm sorry--

587
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:25,975
And I know more than enough
to know

588
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:27,749
that that looks like
every other proposal

589
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:29,084
that's comes across my desk.

590
00:21:29,151 --> 00:21:30,911
Well, that gives me
a shit load of confidence

591
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,053
going into this meeting.

592
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:33,455
I'm not trying to
destroy your confidence.

593
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:34,789
That's the one thing you have
going for you.

594
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:36,057
Then what are you
trying to do?

595
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,275
Mike, you're not here

596
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,927
because you crunched
Sidwell some numbers.

597
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:41,096
You're here because
you solved a problem for him.

598
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:45,517
All right.

599
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:46,885
Get rid of this,
and bring--

600
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:49,170
And bring you everything
I can find on Tony Gianopolous.

601
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:51,473
On it.

602
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:52,524
Amy.

603
00:21:54,343 --> 00:21:55,343
Why aren't you--

604
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:56,344
Why am I an assistant

605
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:58,012
and not an investment banker?

606
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:59,948
I'm getting my PhD
in psychology.

607
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:02,850
Money bores me.

608
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:04,903
I don't know why you needed
to talk to me in chambers,

609
00:22:04,987 --> 00:22:06,154
Mr. Malone.

610
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,372
I was clear on my ruling.

611
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,207
Well, with all due respect,
Your Honor,

612
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,211
your ruling didn't cover
the fact that the S.E.C.

613
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,128
has a vendetta
against Pearson Specter.

614
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:14,512
That's a serious accusation.

615
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:15,747
And if it were the truth,

616
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:17,399
he would have said it
out there, not in here.

617
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:18,733
I'm doing it in private, Sean,

618
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,535
because I don't want to slander
an entire department

619
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:21,736
based on the actions
of two men.

620
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:22,971
Translation?

621
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,539
He doesn't want to be
charged with perjury

622
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,024
because he's lying,
and this is a joke.

623
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:27,442
It wasn't a joke
when I was asked

624
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:29,577
to do the exact same thing
that he's doing right now.

625
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:31,045
What the hell
are you talking about?

626
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:32,414
Before I left the S.E.C.,

627
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,582
I was told to target
Pearson Specter clients.

628
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,217
- And who exactly told you?
- Brian Harris.

629
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:37,452
Then go after him,

630
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,953
'cause all you've got on me
is hearsay,

631
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:40,755
and might I point this is
the accusation of a man

632
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:42,807
who is about to be fired,
which I'd say should be taken

633
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:44,192
with a cubic meter of salt.

634
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,161
Well, that cubic meter of salt

635
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:47,748
might actually
get a little bit smaller

636
00:22:47,763 --> 00:22:49,497
if Sean here were to, say,
open up his files

637
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:50,965
and show us his paper trail.

638
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:53,635
Our work product is covered
under federal regulation,

639
00:22:53,703 --> 00:22:54,936
and he knows that.

640
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:56,723
I also know you're hiding
behind your office

641
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:57,772
and using his court to do it.

642
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,290
All right, all right,
that's enough.

643
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,709
Mr. Malone,
I don't appreciate you

644
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:01,743
using my chambers to testify,

645
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:03,128
and he may not have proof,

646
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:06,280
but if one client
leaves his firm

647
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:08,116
and their charges
miraculously disappear,

648
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:10,052
you're looking at more
than sanctions.

649
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:12,472
You're looking at jail time.

650
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,811
Thank you.

651
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:20,313
Rachel?

652
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:21,531
It's only been a day.

653
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:23,316
You already have a suggestion
for my new deal?

654
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,750
- I do.
- Good.

655
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:26,752
Then which of those five
companies should I go after?

656
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,171
None of them.

657
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:29,739
So you brought me nothing?

658
00:23:29,823 --> 00:23:31,991
No, I brought you
five better options.

659
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:33,938
- What's wrong with the op--
- Just take a look.

660
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:42,034
These companies
have no disposable assets.

661
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:44,336
No, they don't.
They have underperforming assets

662
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,388
that can be turned around
and built into something.

663
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,940
Did you even look into
the companies I gave you?

664
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:49,692
- Yes, I did, but I--
- But what?

665
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,160
Sounds like someone's
been drinking

666
00:23:51,245 --> 00:23:53,029
her boyfriend's kool-aid.
Maybe if more people did,

667
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:54,831
there just might be--
God damn it, Rachel,

668
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:56,749
I'm not in business
to save the world.

669
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:58,317
I asked for
a professional opinion.

670
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:00,253
And I gave you
a professional opinion.

671
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,121
You just don't like it.
No, I don't.

672
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:04,006
And now we're gonna have to work
all day tomorrow

673
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:05,791
to do what I asked you to do
in the first place.

674
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:07,126
You mean
spend all day together.

675
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:08,577
- If that's what it takes.
- Mm-hmm.

676
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:10,129
Did you call this board meeting

677
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,820
just so we could
spend more time together?

678
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:13,489
Did you bring me deals
you knew I'd reject

679
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:14,634
just to avoid it?

680
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:19,004
Look, like I said,

681
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:20,673
I have a meeting on Friday,

682
00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:22,007
and I need to be
prepared for it,

683
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,676
so maybe you should
go back to your office,

684
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:24,861
get cracking,

685
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:27,063
and just give me a call
when you have something.

686
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:31,200
Okay.

687
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:38,124
You're kidding me.

688
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:39,709
So this is all mine?

689
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:41,627
Yup.

690
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:43,462
In 20 days, the public access
will be gone,

691
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,866
and you will have yourself
1/4 mile of private beach.

692
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:48,568
What about
the Southampton city council?

693
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:49,969
What about them?

694
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:52,722
They're a bunch of
public-access loving assholes.

695
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:57,677
Like I said,
what about them?

696
00:24:57,728 --> 00:24:59,712
How'd you do this, Mike?

697
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:01,430
Well, the question isn't
how I did it,

698
00:25:01,515 --> 00:25:02,982
it's why I did it.

699
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:05,484
Oh.
You want something from me.

700
00:25:05,552 --> 00:25:07,486
Just your consideration.

701
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:09,906
Well, you've earned it.
Go ahead.

702
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:19,699
Not interested.

703
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:23,502
You didn't even look at it.

704
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,438
Oh, I don't have to.

705
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,808
You just said that I earned
your consideration.

706
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,876
Mm-hmm,
and you just got it.

707
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:35,264
Gillis industries
is ripe for a turnaround,

708
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:37,850
and I already own 7%.
Congratulations.

709
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,936
Now go beg someone else
for money,

710
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,387
because you're not
getting mine.

711
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:42,972
I don't understand.

712
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:44,123
You don't have to.

713
00:25:44,191 --> 00:25:45,775
Now get the hell
out of my office.

714
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:47,860
- Mr. Gianopolous.
- I said get the hell out.

715
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,154
Hey, Mike.
How's it going?

716
00:25:58,238 --> 00:25:59,455
Fancy meeting you here.

717
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:05,328
It was you.

718
00:26:05,412 --> 00:26:07,446
What was me?

719
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:11,500
I'm just here to thank you
for the advice you once gave me.

720
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:13,252
You know,
back when we were friends.

721
00:26:15,505 --> 00:26:16,505
- Louis.
- No, no, no.

722
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:17,807
No, no, no.

723
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:19,925
You once told me that
my actions had consequences.

724
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:21,227
Remember?

725
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:23,262
Your actions yesterday
have consequences too.

726
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:25,514
What did you say
to Gianopolous?

727
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,766
Not much.

728
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:28,634
Just that you were
the person responsible

729
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:29,635
for his number two
leaving him.

730
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:30,686
I was responsible?

731
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:31,804
He agreed to it.

732
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:33,216
But what he didn't know
was is that

733
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:35,274
it was his own lawyer
who came up with the idea.

734
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:36,542
Now he does.

735
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,444
- And what does that--
- Have to do with it?

736
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:40,196
He may have agreed to it,

737
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,814
but it was a betrayal by you.

738
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:43,199
And here's a little something

739
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:46,252
you obviously do not know
about investment banking.

740
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,338
The only thing more satisfying
to these guys than money

741
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:52,591
is sticking it to someone
who stuck it to them.

742
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:00,383
Louis.

743
00:27:03,353 --> 00:27:04,887
I'm sorry for hurting you
with Sheila.

744
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:07,606
Don't you ever mention
her name to me again.

745
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:10,810
Okay,
but it was a move,

746
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:11,861
like you just did.

747
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:14,113
So can we move on?

748
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,199
Move on?

749
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:21,404
You used the woman I love
to extend your goddamn T.R.O.

750
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:25,741
You knew how I felt about her,
and you did it anyway.

751
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:28,794
I will never, ever forget it
until the day I die.

752
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:30,963
Good luck beating Harvey
without money.

753
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:38,099
I have good news.

754
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:40,389
James Dolan died
and left me the Knicks?

755
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:42,641
Louis stopped Mike
from getting Gianopolous.

756
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,009
He blocked his funding.

757
00:27:44,077 --> 00:27:45,077
Good.

758
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:52,351
You went to Louis
with a problem,

759
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:53,418
he fixed it,

760
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:55,020
and all you're gonna say
is "good"?

761
00:27:55,088 --> 00:27:56,528
Donna, I'm glad
he fixed the problem,

762
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:58,390
but it was a problem
he created.

763
00:27:58,458 --> 00:27:59,458
He created it because

764
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:00,892
when it comes to people
he cares about,

765
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,627
Louis has a blind spot.

766
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:05,364
Yeah, for people and cats
and who knows what else?

767
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:07,132
I'll tell you what else.

768
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,034
He cares about you.

769
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:12,504
What do you want from me,
Donna?

770
00:28:12,572 --> 00:28:15,173
I want you to tell him
he did a good job.

771
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:17,476
I'll tell him
when we come out on top.

772
00:28:17,543 --> 00:28:18,677
Okay, Harvey.

773
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:20,629
You do what you're gonna do,

774
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:21,747
but just remember,

775
00:28:21,814 --> 00:28:23,615
when Louis asked Sheila
to marry him,

776
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:25,884
you were the one he picked
to be his best man,

777
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:28,587
and you said yes.

778
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:41,516
I'm sorry,
but we're not hiring today.

779
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:42,834
I think you'd be
looking for a job

780
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:44,302
given the beat-down
you took in chambers.

781
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:45,503
I'm not sure what

782
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:47,116
Jeff disgruntled employee here
told you,

783
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:48,240
but I'm still standing.

784
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,542
Well, what I told her
is that you lost.

785
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:51,609
Then why are you here?

786
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:53,111
We're here to make you
an offer.

787
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:54,546
You drop all seven cases,

788
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,365
we drop the malicious
prosecution claim.

789
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:57,866
No deal.

790
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,652
Judge Hopkins is going to be
waiting for you to take action.

791
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,454
Too much time goes by,

792
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:03,955
he's gonna think
you're full of shit.

793
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:05,257
But if you fold right now,

794
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:06,591
he's only gonna sanction you

795
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,393
for the exact claim
that we're willing to drop.

796
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:09,928
Which is why
we'll tell the judge

797
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:11,837
that in exchange for those
cases being dropped,

798
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:13,865
we'll give the S.E.C.
unprecedented access

799
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,217
to our clients' books.

800
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:18,436
Which, of course,
you won't be doing.

801
00:29:18,488 --> 00:29:19,704
No, we won't.

802
00:29:19,772 --> 00:29:21,540
So what exactly
am I getting out of this?

803
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:22,741
You get to save face.

804
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:23,792
I do like my face.

805
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:25,127
However, I also like my ass,

806
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:27,162
which will be on the line
if I take this deal.

807
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:30,582
Then you have 24 hours to
decide which one you like more.

808
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:38,974
Mr. Forstman, Mike Ross.

809
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:40,926
No.

810
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:42,594
Sir, I think that
if you hear me out--

811
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:45,664
How the hell
did you find me here?

812
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:47,365
The article in <i>Forbes</i> said

813
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:48,800
you can't go more
than three hours

814
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:50,836
without Rosa's cafe cubanos.

815
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:53,305
That article in <i>Forbes</i>
was six years ago.

816
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:55,240
It also said you never change.

817
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:56,575
Did you also read where I have

818
00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:58,660
every Bud Fox wannabe dumped
in a local landfill?

819
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:00,178
If you do that,

820
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:03,515
you'll miss the opportunity
to get back at Harvey Specter.

821
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:07,852
And what does
a little shit like you

822
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,454
know about Harvey Specter?

823
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,489
I know that he bought that
'63 Aston Martin

824
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:13,492
out from under you,
and you've hated him ever since.

825
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,260
You know he keeps it
in a garage?

826
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:16,394
Doesn't even drive it.

827
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:17,446
What do you want?

828
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:22,751
Gillis Industries.

829
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:24,553
Gillis Industries...
[Cup clatters]

830
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:27,138
Is a black hole
of distressed debt.

831
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,206
I want nothing to do with it.

832
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:29,174
No, it isn't.

833
00:30:29,242 --> 00:30:31,376
It's a '63 Aston Martin.

834
00:30:34,747 --> 00:30:35,747
Who do you work for?

835
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:37,265
Who says I work for anyone?

836
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,483
Because a young kid like you

837
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:41,486
with enough clout
to go after Gillis...

838
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:42,854
I'd know you.

839
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:44,823
I work for Jonathan Sidwell.

840
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:48,527
Okay. You've got
my 230 mil.

841
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:52,531
I only need 80.

842
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:54,866
You don't know what you need.

843
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,904
What happens to the company
is my call.

844
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:00,422
Done.

845
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:08,013
Oh, one more thing,
when you get those papers.

846
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:12,067
I have a feeling there'll be
a provision buried in there

847
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:14,686
that says that
once the deal closes,

848
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:16,721
you cut Sidwell out.

849
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:18,323
I'm sorry, what?

850
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,691
I don't know him,

851
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:21,559
and I don't want him
sucking a chunk out of a deal

852
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:23,695
that can't happen without me.

853
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:38,176
Well?

854
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:39,678
He went for it.

855
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:40,795
That is great.

856
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,847
No, it's not all great.

857
00:31:42,915 --> 00:31:46,251
He'll only give me the money
if I agree to cut out Sidwell.

858
00:31:46,302 --> 00:31:47,302
What?

859
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:49,854
What does cut him out
even mean?

860
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:51,206
It means make sure Sidwell

861
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,091
doesn't get a penny
from this deal.

862
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:56,595
Mike, the second he finds
that out, you're gone.

863
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:58,880
He's not gonna find out
until the deal closes,

864
00:31:58,965 --> 00:32:01,366
and if I don't find the money,
I'm out of a job anyway.

865
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:04,553
Oh, I get it.

866
00:32:04,637 --> 00:32:06,838
At least this way, you get to
leave on the winning side.

867
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:09,908
- We leave on the winning side.
- Who says I'm gonna do that?

868
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:13,922
What happened to, "you think
I'm staying if you leave"?

869
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
Yeah, that was before I knew

870
00:32:15,047 --> 00:32:16,214
you were gonna screw over
Sidwell.

871
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,016
- Amy, I--
- No, he may be

872
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:19,651
a dick sometimes,
but he's the reason you're here.

873
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:22,537
You think I want this?

874
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:23,955
I have to make a choice between

875
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:25,473
the promise I made
to Walter Gillis

876
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:26,725
and what I owe Jonathan.

877
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,526
Mike, Walter Gillis
doesn't give a shit

878
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:29,675
about that promise anymore.

879
00:32:29,695 --> 00:32:30,979
Yeah, but I do,

880
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:32,964
and so do all the people
that work for him.

881
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:38,003
So you're gonna do it.

882
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:41,706
I don't know.

883
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:44,859
But I do know that I keep
having to do shity things

884
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:46,477
just to win this thing,

885
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:48,529
but I'm gonna go make up
for one of them right now.

886
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:57,589
I'm sorry I didn't do
what you asked me to do.

887
00:32:57,657 --> 00:32:59,391
I should have evaluated
your ideas.

888
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:01,226
You should have,

889
00:33:01,294 --> 00:33:02,560
but I should have remembered

890
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:05,213
that you don't always do
what people expect of you.

891
00:33:05,298 --> 00:33:07,498
You mean what people
tell me to do.

892
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,467
I chose the nicer version.

893
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:11,169
Well, I, um...

894
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,188
I finished what I should
have done in the first place.

895
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:15,139
- And?
- And let's go through them.

896
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:17,275
[Elevator dings]

897
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,244
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

898
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:20,578
I figured if I tried
to go upstairs,

899
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,913
you'd have me killed.

900
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:23,448
Oh, is that a joke,
'cause I'm not laughing.

901
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:24,966
Louis, I didn't say it
right the first time.

902
00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:27,052
I want to say it again.
I'm sorry.

903
00:33:28,988 --> 00:33:30,939
You think "I'm sorry"
makes up for what you did?

904
00:33:31,023 --> 00:33:33,325
No, but I'm hoping
that we can move past it

905
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:35,210
and be friends again.

906
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:37,045
Well, the only problem
with that is,

907
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:38,880
is that you and I both know
that you're only here

908
00:33:38,964 --> 00:33:40,404
because I took away
your sugar daddy,

909
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:41,900
and now you want me
to take it easy on you.

910
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,486
Louis, if you don't want to
accept my apology, that's fine,

911
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,237
but I'm not here
from a position of weakness.

912
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:47,745
I'm here from
a position of strength.

913
00:33:47,773 --> 00:33:49,107
Bullshit.
Where'd you get money?

914
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:50,342
You don't have any friends
out there.

915
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:52,711
No, but Harvey has enemies.

916
00:33:52,762 --> 00:33:54,429
What's that supposed to mean?

917
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:55,913
You told me
these guys hold grudges.

918
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:58,233
I just found a guy
with one against Harvey.

919
00:33:58,317 --> 00:33:59,351
You son of a bitch.

920
00:33:59,402 --> 00:34:00,735
You didn't come here
to apologize.

921
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,181
You came here
to rub it in my face.

922
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:03,905
Oh, and I bet you just
can't wait to tell Harvey

923
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:05,509
that I'm the one
who gave you the idea.

924
00:34:05,591 --> 00:34:06,958
Louis, I wasn't even
gonna tell you

925
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:07,959
how I got the idea at all.

926
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,160
I'm still not gonna tell Harvey.

927
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:10,428
Because you want me
to owe you?

928
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:11,936
Because I'm not
as much of an asshole

929
00:34:11,964 --> 00:34:13,598
as you think I am.

930
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:16,151
- What about a buyout?
- Never gonna happen.

931
00:34:16,235 --> 00:34:17,902
He's got a golden parachute.

932
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:19,788
Well, then I've got two people
on the board.

933
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:21,156
I can force a vote.

934
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,108
You do that,
it triggers a stock split.

935
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:24,496
His shares double
in voting power.

936
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:26,478
Yours don't.
I mean, that's all five.

937
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:29,347
None of them work.
No, they don't.

938
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:31,032
So when you told me
you should have

939
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:32,350
evaluated my ideas first,

940
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:33,952
you weren't saying
that they were good.

941
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,221
I was saying
I wasn't doing my job.

942
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:38,590
Which was to let me
figure out for myself

943
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,058
that my ideas weren't good.

944
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,794
I chose the nicer version.

945
00:34:42,862 --> 00:34:47,615
Logan, there are plenty
of other companies out there.

946
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,033
None that we're gonna find
in time

947
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,301
for my board meeting tomorrow.

948
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:51,302
- So push it.
- I can't.

949
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:54,472
I didn't call it.

950
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,141
- And I thought--
- Yeah, I know.

951
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,843
That I only even arranged it
to spend time with you?

952
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:00,028
You really didn't.

953
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:02,580
No, and now they're gonna
ask me tomorrow

954
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:03,915
how Gillis is going,

955
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:05,917
and I'm gonna have to tell them
we might lose,

956
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:07,635
and then they're gonna ask me
what else I have,

957
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,188
and I'm gonna have to
tell them nothing.

958
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:11,556
Or maybe you won't.

959
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:13,758
I told you,
I'm not in that business.

960
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:16,261
Then convince the board
that you should be.

961
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:17,328
Okay.

962
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:18,329
Go back to your office.

963
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,330
Get your files.

964
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:20,548
Like you said,

965
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:24,068
I don't always do
what people expect me to do.

966
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,314
Louis, can I talk to you
for a minute?

967
00:35:36,382 --> 00:35:37,982
Of course.

968
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,619
I heard about what you did
with Gianopolous.

969
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:43,154
Good job.

970
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:46,898
I appreciate that, Harvey.

971
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,626
I do.

972
00:35:48,694 --> 00:35:50,595
Um...

973
00:35:50,663 --> 00:35:52,297
But it doesn't matter.

974
00:35:52,364 --> 00:35:55,233
You know,
he went somewhere else.

975
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:57,602
I know.

976
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,604
He went to Forstman.

977
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:02,407
I just wanted to tell you
you did a good job anyway.

978
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:05,176
See, that's the thing.

979
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,098
I didn't.

980
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:12,684
What are you talking about?

981
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:17,956
Mike got the idea from me.

982
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,627
What?

983
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:23,962
How?

984
00:36:25,464 --> 00:36:26,731
When I cut him off
from Gianopolous,

985
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:28,099
I stuck it in his face,

986
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:32,854
and I told him that
people hold grudges, and I--

987
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:34,739
he must have known
your history with Forstman,

988
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:36,391
and that's why he went to him,
so...

989
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,914
I'm sorry.

990
00:36:42,982 --> 00:36:44,682
God damn it, Louis.

991
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,719
I don't want to keep
being mad at you,

992
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:50,004
but you keep doing
the same shit.

993
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:51,890
But, see, this wasn't me
being duped.

994
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:55,793
No, it was you
letting your emotions

995
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:58,596
lead you into
doing something stupid.

996
00:36:58,647 --> 00:37:00,849
Again.

997
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:04,068
You just had to
stick it in his face.

998
00:37:04,136 --> 00:37:07,322
You know what?

999
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:09,407
I'm done.

1000
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:12,660
It's not fair,
you know.

1001
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:21,286
I'm emotional.
You're cold.

1002
00:37:21,337 --> 00:37:24,539
You're loved,

1003
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:26,124
and I'm hated.

1004
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:30,962
Louis, if I was so cold,

1005
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:34,299
I wouldn't have come here
in the first place.

1006
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,032
What are you doing?

1007
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:49,694
Pouring us a drink.

1008
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:51,493
Cahill took the deal.

1009
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:53,534
All seven cases
are officially dead.

1010
00:37:56,121 --> 00:37:59,840
Jessica, I'm sorry that I didn't
come clean with you before.

1011
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,784
Me too.

1012
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:05,387
Lying to you
was a business decision,

1013
00:38:05,454 --> 00:38:07,639
and it was wrong,

1014
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:08,924
but I want you to know

1015
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:11,059
that I would never lie to you,
man to woman.

1016
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:14,329
I appreciate that.

1017
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,050
We have a problem.

1018
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:21,019
I just got off the phone
with Richard Coleman.

1019
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:22,971
Last week,
Sean Cahill asked him

1020
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:24,856
if I'd ever crossed any lines
in his presence.

1021
00:38:24,941 --> 00:38:26,174
Son of a bitch.

1022
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:27,786
He doesn't want our clients
to leave us.

1023
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,978
He wants them
to cough up dirt on me.

1024
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:32,180
At least none of them did,
or we'd be in trouble right now.

1025
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:34,516
- How do you want to handle it?
- Let's talk about it tomorrow.

1026
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:36,768
Right now, I've got
something else to do.

1027
00:38:36,852 --> 00:38:38,436
Shit.

1028
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:40,855
They wouldn't turn on Harvey.

1029
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:43,091
Cahill wanted us
to drop those cases anyway,

1030
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,576
and I just did him a big favor.

1031
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,494
You couldn't have known that.

1032
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:48,747
It was my job to know that.

1033
00:38:49,882 --> 00:38:51,182
[Slams mug down]

1034
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:55,487
[Light knocking]
Hey, Mike?

1035
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:57,939
- Yeah.
- Harvey Specter's here to--

1036
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,275
- Harvey, what can I do for you?

1037
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:04,847
I wanted to thank you
for the recordings.

1038
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:07,732
Is that why you came
all the way down here?

1039
00:39:07,817 --> 00:39:10,085
I came to tell you I think
you're making a big mistake

1040
00:39:10,152 --> 00:39:12,320
getting into bed with Forstman.
I knew it.

1041
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:13,822
Mike, you don't know this guy.

1042
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:15,957
You could have thanked me
for those recordings days ago,

1043
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:17,926
but instead you picked
the exact day

1044
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:19,294
that I find a new investor
to show up

1045
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:21,129
with your thank-you
and your friendly advice.

1046
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,631
This isn't some move.

1047
00:39:22,698 --> 00:39:24,399
- You only make moves.
- Mike.

1048
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,483
Hey, tell me right now

1049
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:26,929
that you wouldn't do
the same thing

1050
00:39:26,936 --> 00:39:27,869
if you were in my position.

1051
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,571
I was.

1052
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:31,623
And I did.

1053
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:33,207
What?

1054
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:35,277
You think our grudge
is about some car?

1055
00:39:35,344 --> 00:39:37,062
What the hell
are you talking about?

1056
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:39,648
When I was younger,
I made a shady deal with him,

1057
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:41,533
and I paid for it.
Who says that I'm making-

1058
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:42,784
If you haven't, you will,

1059
00:39:42,835 --> 00:39:44,886
because Forstman
doesn't throw money around

1060
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:46,471
without getting something
in return.

1061
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:48,123
He's gonna get money
in return.

1062
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,557
Money is third on his list.

1063
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:51,393
The first two
are getting back at people

1064
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:52,560
and getting control of people.

1065
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:53,895
Maybe you should have
thought of that

1066
00:39:53,946 --> 00:39:55,897
before you had Louis
cut me off from Gianopolous,

1067
00:39:55,948 --> 00:39:58,266
because now I have
no other choice!

1068
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:07,409
You always have a choice.

1069
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,553
Here's to turning around
Piedmont Avionics.

1070
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:22,123
What?

1071
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:24,459
Nothing.

1072
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:25,910
What time is it?

1073
00:40:25,995 --> 00:40:29,631
Too late for you
to change your mind.

1074
00:40:29,682 --> 00:40:32,734
Logan, the board
is going to be wowed.

1075
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:34,635
Well, I wish I had
your confidence.

1076
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:38,156
You are not short
in the confidence department.

1077
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,408
Oh, you don't have to
pay me compliments.

1078
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:42,927
I meant it as an insult.

1079
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:45,180
You know, if this law thing
doesn't work out--

1080
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:47,349
Then I could have a career
in venture capital?

1081
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,318
No, I was gonna say
you could be my assistant.

1082
00:40:50,386 --> 00:40:52,454
Hilarious.

1083
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:55,023
Seriously, Rachel, I--

1084
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:57,042
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1085
00:40:57,126 --> 00:40:59,861
Yes, you could have.

1086
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,429
It just wouldn't have been
as good.

1087
00:41:01,497 --> 00:41:04,065
Humility.

1088
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:05,850
Another thing I love about you.

1089
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:25,720
[Whispering]
Logan, I should go.

1090
00:41:25,788 --> 00:41:26,938
[Whispers]
Rachel, I--

1091
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:28,690
Um...

1092
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:33,061
Good luck tomorrow.

1093

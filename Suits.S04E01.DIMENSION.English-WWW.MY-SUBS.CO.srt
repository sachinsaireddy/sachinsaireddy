00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:31,292
The opposite.
Boy got his shit together.

176
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,661
Max is retiring,
and Logan's taking over.

177
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,330
Let me guess.
He wants a meeting.

178
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,498
He's got one.

179
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,833
With you, tomorrow morning,
10:00 a.m.

180
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,052
Great.
Push it a week.

181
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,254
Harvey, this kid considers
himself a young lion.

182
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,422
He's gonna want
to make his mark,

183
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,141
and the easiest way
for him to do that

184
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,959
is to change lawyers.

185
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,594
Maybe, but the last thing
a lion wants

186
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:52,263
is to have his dinner handed
to him on a silver platter.

187
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:54,966
You're gonna give him
a hunt.

188
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,634
Did you think of that
all on your own?

189
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:57,735
I'm extra sharp.

190
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,521
I haven't worked
a minute all morning.

191
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,489
See, that's funny, 'cause
I was late from all the sex.

192
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,158
Get the hell out
of my office.

193
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,693
♪ Bow chicka bow bow

194
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,503
Look what the cat dragged in.

195
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,506
And you're wearing a vest.
Here it comes.

196
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,042
Here what comes?
Mazel tov.

197
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,011
Congratulations
on your special day.

198
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,762
- That's a good one.
- Harvey, leave him alone.

199
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,181
He looks better than you do.

200
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,349
- Thank you, Donna.
- You're welcome.

201
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,767
Oh, and Mr. Peanut called,

202
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,386
and he said he'd be happy
to lend you his top hat.

203
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,005
- Are you two finished?
- I could go all day.

204
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,356
I think the vest
has had enough.

205
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,058
Yeah.

206
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,860
So you come all the way
down here just to let me know

207
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,979
that you were right
about Walter Gillis?

208
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,591
I came all the way over here
to tell you

209
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,948
I am done playing
in the kiddie pool.

210
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,733
- I'm listening.
- I'm going after a whale.

211
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,702
I think I'm in love.
Let's go to war.

212
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,787
That's the thing.

213
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,289
We're not going to war.

214
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:54,626
Mike, the second
whoever it is finds out

215
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:56,211
that you've got 5%
of their company,

216
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,695
we're going to war
whether you like it or not.

217
00:09:57,746 --> 00:10:00,381
They're not gonna find
that out because I don't own 5%.

218
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,034
Do I need to give you
a tutorial on the procedure?

219
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:04,586
You start by buying shares.

220
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,887
I know what
the procedure is, Harvey.

221
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,255
Well, how many shares
have you bought?

222
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:08,873
- None.
- This phrase,

223
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:10,141
"I know what
the procedure is,"

224
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,260
I don't think it means
what you think it means.

225
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:15,063
Well, as inconceivable
as it might be to you, Harvey,

226
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,731
I'm actually
not going in hostile.

227
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:17,932
What are you talking about?

228
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,234
I'm talking
about approaching someone

229
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,352
to buy their company
in order to keep it alive,

230
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:23,154
instead of selling it
for parts.

231
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,862
You're offering someone
hugs and rainbows.

232
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,442
I'm offering someone
the chance to survive

233
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,194
and banking
that they'll take that chance

234
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,279
rather than give up.

235
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,747
You don't have the money,
do you?

236
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,915
No, I don't.

237
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,950
But even if I did,
I wouldn't use it.

238
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,503
Well,
welcome to what every person

239
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,904
who doesn't have money
has ever said.

240
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,956
Oh, I get it.

241
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,292
You think this is the meeting
where you make fun of my idea.

242
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:45,460
No, no, no, no, no, no.

243
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,911
This is the meeting
where you realize

244
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:50,798
that my idea is happening
whether you like it or not.

245
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,383
Where's the fun
in that meeting?

246
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,768
Oh, the fun?

247
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,754
It's all right over here
on this side of the table.

248
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:58,565
Hey, I'll give you a chance
to get acquainted

249
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,941
with the new reality.

250
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,192
I'll be in my office.

251
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,894
Get back to me
by the end of the day.

252
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,095
Wow.

253
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:07,732
Looks like our baby boy's
all growns up.

254
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,118
Hey, tell me, sweetheart,
you guys validate parking?

255
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,119
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

256
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,604
I've got it right here.

257
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:15,173
And how many hours
is that good for?

258
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,491
What's it matter?

259
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,376
We're just gonna charge it
back to you anyway.

260
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:23,114
You know my secretary is,
like, so much younger

261
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,450
did he say "fitter"?

262
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,288
What did you find out?

263
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:32,423
- Woodall's resurfacing.
- Me too. When?

264
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:33,925
- Next week.
- Me too. Where?

265
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:35,793
- S.E.C.
- Me too. Title?

266
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:37,762
- Supervisor.
- Director.

267
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,013
Me too.
I just threw that in

268
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,815
to make sure
you weren't yes-man-ing me.

269
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:41,933
Talk to me.

270
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:42,850
I found out
the name of the man

271
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,018
Woodall's sending after us.

272
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,437
Jeff Malone.

273
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,440
Jeff Malone is a beast.

274
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:50,525
Well, the only way

275
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,811
to beat a beast
is with a bigger beast.

276
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:55,163
I need to get in there
before everyone else

277
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,915
and let Harvey and Jessica know
that I had the foresight

278
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,450
to look for it,
the cunning to find it,

279
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,651
and the balls to stop it.

280
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,170
Then you take on Malone.

281
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,988
Next stop: Name partner.

282
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,674
- Pearson Specter Litt.
- Okay, you know what?

283
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,461
Just let's not count
our chickens before they hatch.

284
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:11,679
But just for shits and giggles,
say it one more time.

285
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,214
Leave out Specter.

286
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,351
Donna, I got Paul Porter's
annual restructuring proposal.

287
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,354
Can you file it
under "I don't give a shit"?

288
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,172
What about Mike?
You want me to have Rachel

289
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:22,640
prepare a dog and pony show
for him?

290
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,642
- That won't be necessary.
- Why not?

291
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,861
Harvey, I need to talk
to you right now

292
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:28,012
about something very important.

293
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,480
Harvey, why won't it
be necessary?

294
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,065
'Cause you don't beg
the girl to go out with you.

295
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,233
You wait.

296
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,068
She'll call.
That's not even-

297
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,372
Excuse me. Hold on a second.
Um, what if they don't call?

298
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,823
They always call.

299
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:40,325
Well, what about people
who aren't you?

300
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:42,493
- You mean you?
- Yeah, of course I do.

301
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,379
If they don't call,
then they don't call.

302
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,164
But once they smell
your desperation,

303
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,531
they won't respect you,

304
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,367
and you'll never get
what you want anyway.

305
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,302
I'm sorry, did you want
to talk to me about something?

306
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,054
It can wait.

307
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,872
Come to think of it,

308
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:56,724
tell Rachel
when she's back from school

309
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,678
she can have
the rest of the day off.

310
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,049
Harvey.

311
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,102
You do that, you might as well
send Mike a telegram that says,

312
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,154
"I'm not putting any thought
into your idea."

313
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,906
Yeah, might as well.

314
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,275
Okay, are you sure that's how
you want to play this?

315
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,777
Didn't I just answer that?

316
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,614
You did, but this isn't about
whether or not Mike calls back.

317
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,565
This is about you
not letting Mike call the shots.

318
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,117
I let him call the shots,
all he's gonna do

319
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,869
is shoot himself in the foot.
Maybe.

320
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,671
But if this was anybody
other than Mike,

321
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:28,256
you wouldn't be acting
like this.

322
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,507
Bullshit. I don't let
Tony Gianopolous push me around.

323
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:30,908
You think I'm gonna let
Mike Ross?

324
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,127
No, of course you don't let
Tony push you around,

325
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,763
but I've never seen you
mock one of his ideas.

326
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,215
Yeah, because his ideas
aren't ridiculous.

327
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:39,583
This is
Mike's first big idea.

328
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:42,086
And I just told you,
his first big idea sucks.

329
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:44,605
And if you use Rachel
to deliver that message,

330
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,650
this is gonna end badly.

331
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,891
Okay, thanks, mom, but I think

332
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,192
I'm gonna keep playing ball
in the house.

333
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,862
Okay, act like a child
who doesn't want to be told

334
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,169
what to do,
but Mike's a client,

335
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,597
and you need to start
treating him like one.

336
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,616
Donna, the next time
I need help figuring out

337
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,436
how to treat a client,
I'll let you know.

338
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:00,571
Okay, great.

339
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:13,322
Harvey, what can I do
for you?

340
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:15,324
There's a Jeff Malone
waiting in the conference room

341
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,492
wanting to see both of us.

342
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:18,494
Any idea who he is?

343
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:21,430
I've run into him before.
He's a hotshot at the S.E.C.

344
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:24,833
- What do you think he wants?
- Let's go find out.

345
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,138
Ms. Pearson.

346
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:30,523
You must be
Harvey Specter.

347
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,508
I'm Jeff Malone.
I know who you are.

348
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,976
My question is,
why are you here?

349
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:36,812
- You seem hostile.
- You investigate

350
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:39,565
publicly traded companies.
We're not publicly traded.

351
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,200
No, but your clients are.

352
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:43,235
Hence his question
and our hostility.

353
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,187
- Our?
- We tend to stick together

354
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:47,490
when an uninvited guest
interrupts our dinner.

355
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,875
Well, I didn't bring any wine,
but when I go,

356
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
I hope you'll be happy
that I dropped by.

357
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:53,329
Yeah, I doubt that.

358
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,798
So why don't you tell us
which client you're here for

359
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:57,366
and be on your way?

360
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,919
All of them.

361
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:03,372
Since when does the S.E.C.
go around intimidating law firms

362
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,040
by going after their clients?

363
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:06,392
They don't, but they will

364
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:08,677
when Eric Woodall starts there
next week.

365
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:10,846
He comes at our clients
after what he did,

366
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:14,350
this time, he won't get fired,
he'll end up in jail.

367
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:16,569
Except it won't be Woodall
who's coming.

368
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:17,886
It'll be him.

369
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:20,055
Exactly.

370
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,775
Listen, I'm gonna be getting
a vaguely worded assignment

371
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:24,026
with a not-so-vague agenda

372
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:25,411
of getting up
your clients' asses

373
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,496
with the full power
of the S.E.C.

374
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:28,697
And when they ask why--

375
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:30,699
and they always ask why--

376
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,118
I'm gonna be expected
to tell them

377
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:33,752
that it's because
they're clients of your firm.

378
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:35,070
Why are you telling us this?

379
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:37,623
Because he doesn't want
to work for Woodall.

380
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:40,376
He wants to work here.

381
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:43,879
I've always heard
how good you were.

382
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,465
It's nice to see it's true.

383
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,684
Anyway, here's the thing.

384
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm really tired
of being a public servant,

385
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:53,522
and more importantly,
I've always thought

386
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,858
that Eric Woodall
was a, um--

387
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:57,610
oh, shit,
I'll just go ahead and say it.

388
00:15:57,694 --> 00:15:58,694
He's a dick.

389
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,929
Finally, something
we can agree on.

390
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:02,931
Seems to me the only thing
left for us to agree on, Harvey,

391
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:04,116
is my starting salary.

392
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:06,435
[Chuckles]
I'm just kidding.

393
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:08,654
I'm sure
all your new senior partners

394
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,439
get paid the same.

395
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,657
Before you start picking out
floor patterns

396
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:12,958
for your new office,

397
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:15,327
I'd like to discuss this
with my partner first.

398
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:18,113
I'd expect nothing less.

399
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:20,616
Oh, uh, just one more thing.

400
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,551
I haven't been formally given
this assignment yet,

401
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:23,836
so I have no conflict.

402
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,171
But in one more week I will,

403
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:26,505
which means this offer
will be gone.

404
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,673
Is that a threat?

405
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:28,957
I would never threaten someone

406
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:31,060
that I want to be
in business with, Jessica.

407
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:34,063
It's just the truth.

408
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,934
I like him.

409
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:43,972
How did it go with Harvey?

410
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:47,359
Didn't.

411
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:49,478
What do you mean
"it didn't"?

412
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,414
You're the only man here
who can take on Jeff Malone.

413
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:55,084
How could he not see that?
I didn't bring it up.

414
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:57,703
Louis, winter is coming.

415
00:16:57,787 --> 00:16:59,288
I know,
and I'm the night's watch.

416
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,208
But right now
we need to be patient.

417
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:05,678
Patience
is not your strong suit.

418
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,129
Well, today it is.

419
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,664
Because if there's one thing
that I've always known,

420
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:10,883
it's that you do not call
the pretty girl.

421
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,551
You wait for her to call you.

422
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:14,836
Louis, I'm seeing someone.

423
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:16,305
I'm happy for you,

424
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:17,556
though I have no idea why
you're saying that right now.

425
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,007
Katrina, trust me.

426
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:21,176
They're gonna find out
about Jeff Malone soon enough

427
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:22,528
'cause he's gonna come calling.

428
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:25,481
And when he does, they're gonna
come right over to me.

429
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:27,650
Like him all you want.
I'm not hiring him.

430
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,201
- Why not?
- Why do you think?

431
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:30,619
Because you don't like
making decisions

432
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,321
staring down the barrel
of a shotgun.

433
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:33,906
Jessica Pearson.
Nice to meet you.

434
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,791
Jessica,
the man walked in here

435
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:37,326
and offered to fight for us.

436
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:38,877
If it's not him,
who's it gonna be?

437
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:41,714
The guy in the office
next door.

438
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:43,082
Louis?

439
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,217
Harvey, Louis knows
everything there is to know

440
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:46,218
about the S.E.C.

441
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:48,053
He's damn good,
and you know it.

442
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:50,172
This guy isn't damn good.
He's a killer.

443
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:52,508
And he's a prosecutor.
We need a defender.

444
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,892
If I'm in a dark alley,

445
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:55,561
I'd take the killer
over the defender

446
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:56,762
seven days a week.

447
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:59,715
And Eric Woodall's gonna put us
in a dark alley.

448
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,100
Louis is a known quantity.

449
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:03,218
And right now Jeff Malone's
biggest selling point

450
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,937
is telling us
that Woodall is coming.

451
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:06,238
Louis sure as hell didn't,

452
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:08,056
which means
he either didn't know

453
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:09,558
or he wasn't man enough
to come in here

454
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,694
and take the job for himself.

455
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:14,863
Harvey, do you know why
I don't like being strong-armed

456
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:16,282
into decisions?

457
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:19,418
Because I'll never be able
to trust the person who did it.

458
00:18:19,502 --> 00:18:21,704
Then figure out a way
to get someone as good

459
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,540
or hire this guy
and come to terms with it.

460
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:25,874
Because if it's Louis
against Malone

461
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:28,877
in a street fight,
I'm picking that dude.

462
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:39,021
Oh, thank you.

463
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:40,128
Hey, how'd your meeting go

464
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,307
with the mysterious
Harvey Specter?

465
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:43,592
Being a dick
doesn't make him mysterious.

466
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:45,594
Well, then I guess
you're an open book.

467
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:47,806
You know, I was gonna give you
those Daft Punk tickets,

468
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:50,282
but now after that,
I think I'll give them to Edna.

469
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:52,601
Okay, first of all, Edna
was 63 when Daft Punk was born.

470
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:54,453
Really?
With that skin?

471
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:55,537
You know what, I worked hard
to get you those things.

472
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:56,605
Why aren't you going?

473
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:57,939
I dropped the hammer
on Harvey,

474
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,042
which means Rachel's
gonna be working all night.

475
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,277
Hey, what are you doing here?

476
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:04,279
Donna texted me
when I was at Columbia...

477
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:05,381
Mmhmm.

478
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,049
And told me
that Harvey gave me

479
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,551
the rest of the day off
because I'm kicking ass.

480
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:11,503
He's giving you
the rest of the day off?

481
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:12,888
Mmhmm, so I figured

482
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:16,958
we could celebrate over dinner
before the concert.

483
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,171
What, are you jealous 'cause
he never did that for you?

484
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:21,630
[Laughs] Um, no.
That's great.

485
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,766
You pick a place.
I'll meet you there.

486
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:26,185
I got to set up some meetings
for tomorrow first.

487
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:27,309
What about the little owl?

488
00:19:27,354 --> 00:19:30,305
- Yeah.
- Okay.

489
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:42,034
Mike, what are you doing here?

490
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:45,788
You delivered a message,
so now I'm delivering one.

491
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:50,709
Pearson Specter
is formally in review.

492
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:52,511
What did you just say to me?

493
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:55,214
You want my business,
you're gonna have to earn it.

494
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:57,466
- I have earned it.
- By shit-ing on my plan?

495
00:19:57,517 --> 00:19:58,851
You don't have a plan.

496
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:00,168
You're running into a wall.

497
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,303
It's not my job
to crash into it with you.

498
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:02,638
Crash into it?

499
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:04,172
You didn't even ask me
who I'm going after.

500
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:06,275
I didn't have to
because it doesn't matter.

501
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:08,022
But go ahead. Who is it?
Gillis industries.

502
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:10,028
That's not a whale.
That's a monster.

503
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:13,482
A man like Walter Gillis isn't
gonna listen to a guy like you

504
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,734
offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

505
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:18,120
That's exactly
what you said to me

506
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:20,072
before I got him to sell me
his distribution centers.

507
00:20:20,156 --> 00:20:21,690
Congratulations.
You got to walk his dog.

508
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:24,192
That doesn't mean he's gonna
let you marry his daughter.

509
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:26,795
Listen to me.
You want to be my guy?

510
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:28,424
You stop telling me
why I can't do this,

511
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:30,582
and you start figuring out
how I can.

512
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,884
I already told you
how you can.

513
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:33,728
You get some money,
start buying some shares,

514
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:35,587
and you walk in there
with a club

515
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:36,889
and the balls to use it
if you have to.

516
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,891
Harvey, when I told you
my plan's happening

517
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,509
whether you like it or not,
I meant it.

518
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,144
I'm interviewing law firms
tomorrow.

519
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:44,263
You show up with a better
attitude and another move,

520
00:20:44,347 --> 00:20:47,215
or you just lost a client.

521
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:53,519
You want talk about it?

522
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:56,559
Talk about what?

523
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,646
About whatever's going on
with you and Harvey.

524
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:03,065
[Sighs]

525
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:04,951
Why does everybody think
that I was born yesterday?

526
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:07,102
I tell you that he gives me
the rest of the day off work,

527
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:09,154
you vanish until dinner,
and then you're pissed off

528
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:10,373
for the rest of the night,

529
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,325
so it doesn't take
a rocket scientist.

530
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:14,126
Clearly.

531
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:16,629
I meant "I love you."

532
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:18,497
Mmhmm, nice recovery.

533
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:20,282
Doesn't get you
out of answering my question.

534
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:21,294
You really want to know?

535
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:23,118
I'll tell you.

536
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,805
Harvey was Michael Jordan.

537
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:29,592
Now it's Lebron's time,
and he can't take it.

538
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:32,294
That's a pretty big accusation
to make.

539
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:34,680
Well, there's more
to the story than you know.

540
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:36,265
- What?
- Right, so come on.

541
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:38,634
I said I didn't want to get
between you two.

542
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:40,069
What?

543
00:21:40,136 --> 00:21:42,688
[Sighs]

544
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:45,157
Let's just say
that you kicking ass for him

545
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:48,327
isn't the reason
you got the day off.

546
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,201
I thought
you had law school today.

547
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:58,204
I do right after this.

548
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:00,289
He told you.

549
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,991
Did you think he wouldn't?

550
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,793
Look, if you want to send
a message to Mike,

551
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:04,994
go right ahead.

552
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:06,429
If you want me to send
a message to Mike,

553
00:22:06,496 --> 00:22:09,015
tell me when and where, but...

554
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:12,601
Please don't ever use me
like that again.

555
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:15,504
You're right.

556
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:17,974
I'm what now?

557
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,859
I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry.

558
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:21,560
Is it April fools' day?

559
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:23,195
No, but don't ever
let it be said

560
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,363
that I can't admit
when I'm wrong.

561
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:25,982
Then I will stop
saying that.

562
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,566
Didn't you say
you have class today?

563
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:30,119
I'm on my way.

564
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:31,871
What was that all about?

565
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:32,955
Just some
administrative stuff.

566
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:35,825
Administrative stuff.
You and Rachel.

567
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,326
I don't want to talk
about it.

568
00:22:37,377 --> 00:22:38,711
You mean about how everything
I said would happen happened,

569
00:22:38,795 --> 00:22:40,863
and now you realize I was right
the whole time?

570
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:42,081
No one likes
a gloater, Donna.

571
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:43,332
Well, then I guess

572
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:44,533
the Harvey Specter University
of gloating

573
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:45,835
is gonna have to shut down.

574
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:49,839
I can still give lectures
on the weekend.

575
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,223
You want to hear it?

576
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:53,259
You were right.

577
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:54,427
[Sighs]

578
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:55,678
Call Ray.

579
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:58,047
I'm gonna go let Mike know
I'm his lawyer.

580
00:22:58,098 --> 00:23:01,650
You're gonna push
a meeting with me?

581
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:04,854
Harvey, Logan Sanders
is here to see you.

582
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:07,073
First of all,
I don't appreciate

583
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:08,917
you stomping into my office
with an attitude.

584
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:10,693
Yeah, well, I don't appreciate
being put off,

585
00:23:10,744 --> 00:23:12,078
especially when I know
that you never pushed a meeting

586
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:13,412
with my father.

587
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:14,897
Your father
never went to Jessica

588
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:16,449
to set a meeting with me.

589
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,918
Then I assume that next time
I call you directly,

590
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:20,286
you'll pick up the phone.

591
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,457
Logan, let me give you
the ABCs of me.

592
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,093
I don't take meetings.
I set them.

593
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:29,745
And my respect isn't demanded.
It's earned.

594
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:32,598
That's only two things.
What's "C"?

595
00:23:32,682 --> 00:23:35,084
"C" is for people who show me
they know "A" and "B."

596
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:37,970
Well, since we're quoting
<i>Jerry Maguire,</i>

597
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:39,939
all I want is for you
to show me the money.

598
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:43,275
You just took step number one
towards earning my respect.

599
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,227
And I dig that about you.
Great.

600
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,097
Would it be too much trouble for
me to discuss my business now?

601
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:50,699
Well, I was gonna move on
to <i>Crimson Tide,</i>

602
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:52,068
but, yeah, go ahead.

603
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,702
Knock yourself out.

604
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,621
You ever hear of a family
called the Winwards?

605
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:58,124
No. Should I?

606
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,441
In 1950, they were worth
the equivalent

607
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,660
of a billion dollars.

608
00:24:01,745 --> 00:24:04,780
By 1988, one of them owned
a couple of dry cleaners.

609
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:06,215
And it didn't happen
because they squandered it.

610
00:24:06,282 --> 00:24:08,501
It happened
because they stayed a dinosaur.

611
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:09,985
You don't want to become
a dinosaur.

612
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:11,137
No.
[Sighs]

613
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:14,640
I like to think of myself
as a shark.

614
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:16,475
Keep moving forward or die.

615
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,144
You're talking
hostile takeover.

616
00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:20,396
You think I'd be here
if I wasn't?

617
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:22,515
You just took step number two
towards earning my respect.

618
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,732
What's the company?

619
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,936
Gillis Industries,
and I already own 4.9%.

620
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,438
Logan, we have to end
this conversation right now.

621
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:30,570
What are you talking about?

622
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:32,074
I thought I just earned
your respect.

623
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:33,275
You did,
but we have a conflict.

624
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:34,660
What do you mean,
you have a conflict?

625
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:35,995
I mean we have a conflict.

626
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,997
What are you gonna do
about it?

627
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:40,149
I'm gonna go
and resolve it.

628
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,369
Well, you better do it fast,
because I am in on this.

629
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:45,621
And that means you're either
with me or against me.

630
00:24:45,672 --> 00:24:49,158
That includes all $1 billion
of my business.

631
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:01,336
Hey. Prunie?

632
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:03,722
- What is that?
- It's a prune smoothie.

633
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:05,224
I invented it myself.

634
00:25:05,308 --> 00:25:06,475
Rain check.

635
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:10,863
Louis, guess who
stopped by yesterday

636
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:12,867
for an impromptu meeting
with Jessica and Harvey.

637
00:25:12,949 --> 00:25:14,700
Please tell me
it was Dick Cheney.

638
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:16,685
Why would you want it
to be Dick Cheney?

639
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:19,021
Why wouldn't I want it
to be Iron Dick?

640
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:20,539
Holy shit, I think I know
who you were talking about.

641
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:22,458
I think you do too.

642
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:23,826
Is it a certain S.E.C. beast

643
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:26,495
whose name happens to rhyme
with schmeff schmalone?

644
00:25:26,546 --> 00:25:28,914
Schmess it is,
and schmess it does.

645
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,416
Well, schmuck me.

646
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,218
Louis, we have a problem.

647
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:34,369
What's the problem?
As if I didn't know.

648
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:37,873
[Chuckles]

649
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:41,710
I just got out of a meeting
with Logan Sanders.

650
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:43,846
Logan Sanders?

651
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:46,232
This isn't about--
about what?

652
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:48,317
Then-never mind.

653
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:49,735
What's the problem?

654
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:50,736
He wants to go
after the same company

655
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,104
that Mike pitched me first.

656
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:53,606
So what's the problem?
Mike brought it to you first.

657
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,940
You're obligated
to stick with him.

658
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:57,943
The problem is Mike formally
put us in review.

659
00:25:58,028 --> 00:26:00,729
Holy shit.
That's why you're coming to me.

660
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,281
You're gonna lose Mike,

661
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:03,866
and you want to know
if there's any way around it?

662
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,335
- Is there?
- No, Harvey.

663
00:26:06,402 --> 00:26:09,338
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to drop Mike.

664
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:23,103
- What happened with Harvey?
- Nothing.

665
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:25,655
He had an emergency with Mike.

666
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:29,492
Fine, but don't you think now
is the time to act for yourself?

667
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:31,504
No, we have a good plan,
and we're sticking to it.

668
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,181
They're stewing on Malone,
and the more they stew--

669
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:36,933
The more leverage we have.

670
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:38,268
Both: Name partner.

671
00:26:38,336 --> 00:26:41,388
And as I've said,
all we need to do is be patient.

672
00:26:41,472 --> 00:26:45,508
Well, patience may be
one of your virtues,

673
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,561
but it is not one of mine.

674
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:54,451
I didn't want to jinx it.

675
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:56,987
You didn't.

676
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:06,546
Katrina, this is
one of the sweetest things

677
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:07,914
anyone's ever done for me.

678
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:09,966
I want to make sure
you don't waste your opportunity

679
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:12,886
to get this.

680
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,972
I promise I won't.

681
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,543
[Shudders]

682
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,933
What are you doing here?

683
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:28,652
We shouldn't be seen together.

684
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:30,053
You had no problem walking
into my place of business.

685
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:31,945
Why should I have a problem
walking into yours?

686
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:34,324
Because unless you're here
to tell me that I have the job,

687
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:36,777
then you're putting
my position here in jeopardy.

688
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:38,061
How do you think I felt

689
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,496
when I found the man
that I'm sleeping with

690
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:42,199
standing in my conference room?

691
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,667
Jessica, will you please
lower your voice?

692
00:27:43,734 --> 00:27:44,668
Not only that,
but you stood there

693
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:46,253
with a shit-eating grin
on your face

694
00:27:46,337 --> 00:27:48,672
and tried to strong-arm me
into giving you a job.

695
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:51,708
Are you as turned on
as I am right now?

696
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:54,461
[Laughs]
You're not funny.

697
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:56,546
Why didn't you come to me first
with this?

698
00:27:56,597 --> 00:27:58,682
Because if I had come to you
with this first,

699
00:27:58,749 --> 00:28:01,134
you would have thought I was
trading on our relationship.

700
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:02,752
- Aren't you?
- No.

701
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:03,937
And if we weren't together,

702
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:05,422
I would have gone
to both of you, all right?

703
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:06,923
So I went to both of you.

704
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:09,693
Now it may not
have been perfect, but...

705
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,445
There was no perfect way
of doing it,

706
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:12,595
unless I hadn't done it.

707
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,264
Now that sounds
pretty perfect to me.

708
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:15,265
What are you so afraid of?

709
00:28:15,316 --> 00:28:16,566
Do I have to draw you
a picture?

710
00:28:16,617 --> 00:28:17,767
I'm not the one
that made up the saying

711
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:19,236
"you don't shit
where you eat."

712
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:21,788
Am I the shit or the food in
this little painting of yours?

713
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:23,206
Because if we're just a fling,

714
00:28:23,274 --> 00:28:24,291
then what difference
does it make

715
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,992
whether I work with you
or not?

716
00:28:26,077 --> 00:28:27,911
I didn't say
we're just a fling.

717
00:28:27,962 --> 00:28:29,779
Then if there really
is a chance for us,

718
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:31,114
then why not go for both?

719
00:28:31,165 --> 00:28:34,217
Because I've seen what happens
when things go south

720
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:35,669
between partners,

721
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:37,637
and I'm not willing to put
my business in jeopardy.

722
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:38,889
Your business.

723
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:42,142
Yes, my business.

724
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:45,095
The one that I have fought
tooth and nail to keep together,

725
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:48,298
the same business that
you strolled into with a shotgun

726
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:53,069
and said, "marry me,
or I'll start shooting."

727
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:55,188
Jess, if you want me
to apologize

728
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:56,973
for the way that I asked,
then I will.

729
00:28:57,024 --> 00:28:59,693
But I don't ask for things
that I don't want.

730
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:02,312
And what I want is to work
at Pearson Specter

731
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:05,081
and to keep seeing you.

732
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:09,202
Those two things
are not both gonna happen.

733
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:11,121
Then I guess
you have to decide

734
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:12,822
what's more important to you--

735
00:29:12,874 --> 00:29:17,043
what we have
or what you have.

736
00:29:23,518 --> 00:29:24,935
Hey, Mike.

737
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:26,186
There's another prospect here
to see you,

738
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,854
but he's late,
and his tie's too fat.

739
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:29,005
Should I let him in?

740
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:30,607
You tell her to say
all that garbage?

741
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:32,275
He didn't need to,
Johnnie fat tie.

742
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:34,194
Yeah, I guess I have time
for one more meeting.

743
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:35,896
- Mike, I need to talk to you.
- Although, I'm sorry, sir.

744
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,148
You've missed the pastries.
I can call you some up.

745
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:39,649
Listen to me.

746
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,351
I came down here
because I wanted to tell you

747
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:43,236
if you want to run
through this wall,

748
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:44,237
I'm ready to run through it
with you.

749
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:45,238
Good.

750
00:29:45,323 --> 00:29:47,908
But I can't.

751
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:48,909
What?

752
00:29:48,993 --> 00:29:50,160
What I can do is tell you

753
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:51,495
I'm ready
to run through another one.

754
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:52,946
What the hell
are you talking about?

755
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:55,248
- We have a conflict.
- Bullshit.

756
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,534
Who is it?
It's not bullshit.

757
00:29:57,585 --> 00:29:58,585
Then who is it?

758
00:29:58,669 --> 00:29:59,920
You know
I can't tell you that.

759
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:00,971
No, what I know
is that it's very convenient

760
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:02,389
that you suddenly
have a conflict

761
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:04,874
the day after you tell me
that my idea isn't good enough.

762
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:06,247
I don't find it convenient
at all,

763
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,394
but you put us in review,

764
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:09,262
and now I have to go
with the other client.

765
00:30:09,347 --> 00:30:11,314
I put you in review because
you refused to get on board.

766
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:12,516
And I just told you,

767
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:13,984
I want to run
through another wall with you,

768
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,886
and we still can
if you drop this.

769
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:19,155
And why should I be the one
to drop it?

770
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:22,108
Because they're not going to,
and I have to stick with them.

771
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:23,743
And I'm telling you,
you're gonna lose.

772
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:24,861
What, because
you're on the other side?

773
00:30:24,912 --> 00:30:26,162
Because their plan
is better.

774
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,531
Says
the professional bullshit-er

775
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:30,166
who has a brand-new vested
interest in me bowing out.

776
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:32,002
I'm gonna let that go.

777
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,453
But if you don't let this go,

778
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:38,592
I can't represent you
on anything until it's over.

779
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:42,879
Then I guess
we're done here.

780
00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:01,948
You cook?

781
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:04,117
You come home to this
in your kitchen,

782
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:06,319
and that's what you're going
to ask me?

783
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:07,487
Well, I was gonna ask you

784
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:08,822
how the hell you got
into my apartment,

785
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:11,941
but I knew
you weren't gonna tell me.

786
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:13,243
Do you remember
when you told me

787
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:16,329
I should think about taking
some morning meetings?

788
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,251
I can't say that
it's never crossed my mind,

789
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:22,636
but you really think
it's a good idea--

790
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,753
Jeff Malone.

791
00:31:23,804 --> 00:31:26,723
Well, he's not my type.

792
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,807
You gotta be kidding me.

793
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:29,059
Why didn't you tell me
yesterday?

794
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:30,644
Because I wasn't gonna
hire him yesterday,

795
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:32,479
so it was
none of your business.

796
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:35,565
But today I might,
so now it is.

797
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,767
And you want to know
how I feel about it.

798
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:39,135
You're my partner.

799
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:41,354
Well, I already told you
how I feel about hiring him.

800
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:42,439
This doesn't change that.

801
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,609
Good to know.

802
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,146
Seems like something else
is on your mind.

803
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:52,699
He doesn't
just want to work together.

804
00:31:52,783 --> 00:31:54,984
He wants us
to keep seeing each other.

805
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:56,986
And you don't want to risk
the one to have the other.

806
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,123
No. I don't.

807
00:32:00,174 --> 00:32:01,658
I've been there.

808
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,293
I know.

809
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:08,498
Then you need to figure out
which is more important.

810
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:11,801
I guess I do.

811
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:17,273
So you two have, um...

812
00:32:17,341 --> 00:32:19,842
Yes.

813
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:22,812
So he's seen you naked?

814
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:25,899
That's usually
how these things work.

815
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,491
Are you picturing me naked
right now?

816
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:36,459
Maybe.

817
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:38,211
Yes.

818
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:40,880
Go wash your hands.

819
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:47,337
Don't spend too much time
in that bathroom.

820
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:49,172
Let me get this straight.

821
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:50,873
You come to me
with a killer idea,

822
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,425
and all of a sudden
you don't want to do it anymore

823
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,977
'cause you lost your BFF?

824
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:56,596
I don't want to do it because
it's not a killer idea anymore.

825
00:32:56,681 --> 00:32:58,765
- Why the hell not?
- Because Harvey has a conflict,

826
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:00,889
which means somebody already
has a dog in the fight.

827
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,352
- Who gives a shit?
- I do.

828
00:33:02,403 --> 00:33:05,355
'Cause whoever it is
is already buying shares.

829
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:06,906
You didn't come in here
to give up.

830
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:08,525
You came in here
to get my money.

831
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:09,693
You're damn right
I did.

832
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:11,528
I give you my money,
now I have downside.

833
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:13,029
Jonathan, look.

834
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,448
You said you wanted
a home run.

835
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:16,666
You gotta pull out
your checkbook,

836
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:18,055
'cause I can't compete
without it.

837
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:19,869
- You could yesterday.
- Now it's today.

838
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,371
And you're still
going in there

839
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:22,572
another banker in a suit,

840
00:33:22,623 --> 00:33:25,258
hoping he'll trust you
based on nothing.

841
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:29,078
I've got more than nothing.

842
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,514
What the hell
are you talking about?

843
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:33,299
Trust me.

844
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:35,769
I did my homework.

845
00:33:35,853 --> 00:33:37,487
Batter up.

846
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,224
What are you doing here?

847
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:46,552
I said I'd tell you

848
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,653
what we were gonna do
with your centers

849
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:48,987
five seconds after we closed.

850
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,590
When did we close?

851
00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:53,676
About three seconds ago.

852
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,012
I guess we better hurry.

853
00:33:58,098 --> 00:34:00,683
All right, what's going
to happen to my employees?

854
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:02,435
We're going to sell
your distribution centers

855
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:04,637
to a pharmaceutical company

856
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:06,188
as distribution centers.

857
00:34:06,273 --> 00:34:07,440
They use your workers.

858
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:10,226
They hit the ground running.
Win-win.

859
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,611
You're a man of your word.

860

00:41:49,235 --> 00:41:50,635
Hey.

1036
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:53,605
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

1037
00:41:53,656 --> 00:41:54,740
This thing
between me and Harvey--

1038
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:56,859
it doesn't have to affect us.

1039
00:41:56,943 --> 00:42:00,662
We won't let it.

1040
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:02,664
I didn't know
that Logan Sanders

1041
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:05,417
took over his father's company
until today.

1042
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:07,169
What does that have to do
with anything?

1043
00:42:07,253 --> 00:42:10,839
- He's Harvey's client.
- Yeah, so?

1044
00:42:12,926 --> 00:42:16,929
Do you remember
when I told you that I...

1045
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:20,098
That I once had an affair
with a married man?

1046
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:23,468
It was him.
